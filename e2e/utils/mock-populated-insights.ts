/**
 * A POPULATED Insights overview fixture.
 *
 * The mobile-overflow guard exists to prove that a page carrying real content
 * does not scroll sideways. Against the shared e2e account — which owns no
 * measurements — `/insights` resolves to its empty state, and an empty page
 * trivially fits any viewport. Every section below therefore gets a body:
 * populated wellness scores, a full vitals grid, and the "signals of the day"
 * card whose heading carries the long plain-language provenance caption.
 *
 * The strings are deliberately long. Prose in a heading's trailing `action`
 * slot is exactly what widened the page in the first place, and a fixture with
 * short labels would not reproduce it.
