/**
 * The E2E suite's `test` / `expect` entry point.
 *
 * Every spec imports from here instead of from `@playwright/test`, and the
 * structural guard `src/__tests__/e2e-route-cleanup-guard.test.ts` keeps it
 * that way.
 *
 * ## Why
 *
 * A spec that registers `page.route(...)` in a `beforeEach` leaves the handler
 * armed until the context closes. If the handler is async — `route.fetch()`,
 * an `await` before `route.fulfill()` — teardown can close the context while
 * one invocation is still in flight. The callback then rejects against a dead
 * target, Playwright attributes the rejection to the test that just finished,
 * and a test that had already passed is reported as failed. With `retries: 2`
 * plus `failOnFlakyTests` on CI, that is a release blocker whose trigger is
 * timing, not code.
 *
 * The remedy Playwright names is `unrouteAll({ behavior: "ignoreErrors" })`
 * before the test ends. Written per spec that is 36 copies of the same three
 * lines and one forgotten copy away from the same failure. Written as an auto
 * fixture it happens for every test in the suite, including specs nobody has
 * written yet, and a spec author never has to know it exists.
 *
 * ## What it covers
 *
 * - `page.route(...)` on every page in the test's context.
 * - `context.route(...)` on the context itself.
 * - Page event listeners for the interactive event types a spec subscribes to.
 *   A listener that awaits something (a `dialog` handler, a `response` handler
 *   that reads a body) can reject after teardown for exactly the same reason a
 *   route handler can.
 *
 * ## What it does not cover
 *
 * A page that lives in a context the spec created itself — `browser.newContext()`
 * inside a helper — is invisible here, because this fixture can only see the
 * context Playwright built for the test. `share-documents.spec.ts` is the one
 * spec that does this; it owns those contexts and has to clean them up itself.

/**
 * Page event types cleared at teardown. Deliberately not the lifecycle events

 * standing in, and nothing in the suite hangs work off them. These are the

 * running when the context goes away.
