/**
 * The dashboard survives hydration in the configuration that ships.
 *
 * `/` is an RSC wrapper that runs the dashboard's reads server-side and hands
 * them to TanStack through a `HydrationBoundary` (`src/app/page.tsx`), so the
 * first HTML already carries real tiles. It only does that when
 * `DASHBOARD_SSR_PREFETCH` is not `"false"` — which is the default, and
 * therefore what every self-hoster runs.
 *
 * The rest of the suite runs against a server with that flag OFF, because the
 * dashboard specs drive their fixtures through `page.route` and a route mock
 * only sees client fetches. So nothing here ever exercised the shipped path,
 * and a React #418 hydration bailout sat on `/` for a signed-in account on
 * every cold load: the app shell hydrates first and its queries answer before
 * the streamed dashboard boundary hydrates, so the dashboard's first CLIENT
 * render read an account payload (and an achievements payload, and its own
 * in-flight tiles) the server never had. React threw the streamed tree away
 * and rebuilt it — paying for the prefetch and delivering none of it.
 *
 * This spec talks to the second server (`SSR_PREFETCH_BASE_URL`, prefetch ON,
 * no route mocks, the real seeded account) and asserts two things a mocked
 * spec cannot:
 *
 *  1. the browser reports no hydration error at all;
 *  2. the tile node the SERVER streamed is still the same DOM node once the
 *     page settles. A bailout re-creates it, so node identity is the honest
 *     witness that the server's work survived instead of being re-done. The
 *     probe only reads identity — writing a marker attribute onto server HTML
 *     would be a hydration mismatch of its own making.
 *
 * Runs on both viewport projects, because the defect reproduced on both.
