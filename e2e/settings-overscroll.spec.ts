/**
 * Vertical over-scroll regression guard (the recurring class behind the
 * v1.25.11 settings fix): the scroll viewport must never extend far past
 * the last content element. The rule the guard pins is structural — only
 * the AuthShell owns the scroll height and the bottom padding
 * (`pt-6 pb-20` on the wrapper, plus the `<md` bottom-nav clearance on
 * `<main>`); a page/section must never add its own viewport-height
 * reserve or bottom gutter, because every such nested reserve stacks on
 * the shell's own budget and reopens the dark-band-below-the-last-card
 * bug.
 *
 * The assertion: `main.scrollHeight` ≤ bottom edge of the lowest real
 * content element + the shell-owned padding + tolerance. "Real content"
 * is measured against each element's CONTENT-box bottom, not its padding-
 * box: a sub-shell column that re-declares its own bottom gutter (`pb-*`)
 * no longer folds that gutter into `contentBottom`, so a redundant reserve
 * FAILS the assertion instead of being absorbed by it. Runs across both
 * two-column sub-shells — Settings AND Admin (they share the grid-floor
 * source) — at desktop AND phone-shaped viewports, because the two shell
 * paddings differ per breakpoint.
