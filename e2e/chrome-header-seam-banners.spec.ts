/**
 * The seam again, this time with chrome above it.
 *
 * `chrome-header-seam.spec.ts` measures the two header borders on a shell with
 * nothing above them. That is the state almost every session is in, and it is
 * also the only state in which the seam cannot break: with no banner painted,
 * the sidebar logo band and the top bar both start at y=0 whatever the layout
 * does with them.
 *
 * The banners are the case that breaks it. Each one is a full-width strip that
 * paints above the top bar, and while they lived INSIDE the content column they
 * pushed the top bar down while the sidebar band stayed where it was — one line
 * across the top of the app became two lines a banner-height apart, and three
 * can stack at once. Measured before the fix, on the French locale strip: one
 * banner offset the two borders by 66.5px at 768px and 61.0px at 1280px, and
 * all three together by 184.5px and 143.0px. So this spec forces them on and
 * measures the same two borders.
 *
 * ## How each banner is forced
 *
 * Honestly, through the condition the component actually reads — no injected
 * DOM, no test-only prop:
 *
 *   - **Maintainership** paints on a locale HealthLog does not hand-maintain.
 *     The context cookie is switched from `en` to `fr`, which is what a
 *     French-speaking user's browser carries. The swap happens with no page
 *     alive (`about:blank`): `I18nProvider` rewrites `healthlog-locale` from
 *     its own active locale on mount, so a cookie written under a live English
 *     page is reverted within the second.
 *   - **Shared record** paints while this session is inside somebody else's
 *     record, so this file switches into one. It used to fake the state instead
 *     — capture `/api/auth/me`, serve it back with the sharing block filled —
 *     because the switch is stamped on the SESSION ROW and moving the shared
 *     jar's row would move it for every spec holding that cookie. v1.37.0 took
 *     that shortcut away and gave back the thing that made it necessary: the
 *     record context is now proved across the payload, the fence store and the
 *     transition machine together, so a payload alone cannot produce it; and a
 *     spec that switches gets a login of its own
 *     (`SEAM_BANNERS_STORAGE_STATE_PATH`), which is what keeps this file's reach
 *     inside this file. The grant is the seeded whole-record READ on
 *     `e2e-level-read` — whole-record deliberately, because a narrowed one drops
 *     nav destinations and that is a different spec's subject.
 *   - **Offline** paints while `navigator.onLine` is false, which
 *     `context.setOffline(true)` produces for real, event and all. It is armed
 *     last because it is the only stage a navigation cannot follow, and it is
 *     armed after the switch for the same reason: entering a record is a
 *     network act.
 *
 * The demo banner is the one that cannot be forced from a spec: `DEMO_MODE` is
 * a server env var read by the root layout, and the suite shares one server
 * whose mutations would all be blocked by turning it on. It is the same strip
 * as the other three (`border-b px-3 py-2 text-xs`) in the same place in the
 * stack, so the three forced here exercise its geometry; nothing in the stack
 * is specific to which banner is in it.
 *
 * ## What is asserted
 *
 * Two properties, and the second is why the banners were hoisted above the
 * shell row rather than nudged inside it:
 *
 *   1. The seam holds — the two header borders keep sharing one line at every
 *      stack depth, so chrome above the header cannot displace one band and
 *      not the other.
 *   2. The shell stays inside the viewport — the banners are part of the
 *      `h-dvh` budget, not added on top of it, so no depth of stack introduces
 *      a page-level scrollbar. `<main>` remains the only vertical scroller.
 *
 * Property 2 is measured below `md` as well as above it, where there is no
 * sidebar and therefore no seam, because the scroll model is the half of the
 * layout that the hoist could have broken at that breakpoint. It used to get
 * there by running the file in the `chromium-mobile` project. It cannot any
 * more: this file moves a session's record selector, and a second PROJECT is
 * the one thing a separate cookie jar cannot fix — it would drive the same
 * session row from two browsers at once. So the narrow viewport is measured
 * inside the desktop project instead. Nothing is lost by that: the shell picks
 * its column layout and its scroller from width-driven rules, and the property
 * under test is a scroll height in CSS pixels.
