/**
 * Visits — the incidental-linking promise, proven end to end once.
 *
 * The flow this milestone is checked against, in one script:
 *
 *   1. create a visit with ONLY a date — nothing else touched, Save enabled;
 *   2. it appears in the list;
 *   3. open a document dated inside the ±7-day window;
 *   4. the suggestion offers that visit;
 *   5. take the offer;
 *   6. the document's detail names the visit it now belongs to.
 *
 * Every assertion addresses a stable `data-slot`, never viewport text: the
 * copy is i18n-driven and the mobile project renders the same slots at a
 * different size, so a text assertion would break for the wrong reason.
 *
 * The visit is created through the API rather than by driving the sheet twice:
 * step 1 is about the SAVE being possible with only a date, which the sheet
 * assertion below covers, and the linking half needs a visit whose instant is
 * pinned relative to the seeded document's date.
