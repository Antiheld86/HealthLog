/**
 * v1.18.8 — common lab biomarker → LOINC + canonical UCUM mapping.
 *
 * The lab-result `analyte` and `unit` are user free-text (no closed enum), so
 * the FHIR exporter has historically emitted a text-only `code` with a
 * display-only `unit` — honest about what it could validate. This module
 * closes the gap WITHOUT over-asserting: a curated map of the COMMON
 * biomarkers the app and docs surface (the demo's 9-biomarker panel + the
 * usual lipid / metabolic / liver / kidney / inflammation set). An analyte
 * that resolves here gets a real LOINC `coding` ALONGSIDE the user's
 * `code.text`, and the canonical UCUM `code` on the value WHEN the recorded
 * unit matches (or normalises to) the mapped canonical symbol. An analyte
 * that does NOT resolve keeps the exact pre-v1.18.8 text-only + unit-display
 * behaviour — no fabricated terminology.
 *
 * Conservative by design: only biomarkers whose LOINC term is well-established
 * are included. When in doubt, a biomarker is left OUT (text-only stays the
 * honest default) rather than guessed.
 *
 * Systems:
 *   LOINC — http://loinc.org
 *   UCUM  — http://unitsofmeasure.org
 *
 * FORWARD-COMPAT (v1.19.0 Biomarker catalog): the schema has a planned
 * user-scoped `Biomarker` catalog (`LabResult.biomarkerId`, NULL today). Once
 * a backfill links rows to a canonical analyte + unit, the resolved canonical
 * name should drive this lookup AHEAD of the raw free-text. `resolveLabCoding`
 * therefore accepts an optional `canonicalName` (the catalog's resolved name)
 * which takes precedence over the free-text `analyte`; the lab DTO does not
 * yet carry that field, so the call site passes only `analyte` today. When the
 * DTO gains a `biomarkerCanonicalName` (or similar), thread it in — no other
 * change to this module is required.
 *
 * SERVER-ONLY since the localised alias index landed: the index reads every
 * shipped message bundle through `@/lib/i18n/shared-resolve`. The single
 * caller is the FHIR exporter, which runs on the server; a client that needs
 * to show a biomarker's name resolves it through the labs catalog instead.

 * resolve the same day.

 * The hand-written aliases WIN on a conflict. They were verified one by one
 * over several releases; a derived name that folds onto the same key as one of
 * them is a duplicate and harmless, and one that folds onto a DIFFERENT key
 * would be a bundle bug, so it is refused here and the guard suite fails on
 * it — a translation typo must not quietly re-point an existing alias at
 * another analyte.
 *
 * Known limit: the index is built from the names the bundles carry TODAY,
