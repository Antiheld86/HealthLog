/**
 * v1.11.0 — shared per-resource FHIR R4 emitters.
 *
 * The Observation / MedicationStatement / MedicationAdministration / Patient /
 * Coverage / Condition / Encounter / cycle builders (with their
 * LOINC/ATC/SNOMED/UCUM codings and the `survey` wellness split) are small pure
 * functions over the SAME `DoctorReportData` the document-bundle builder
 * consumes. This barrel is their one public face: `buildFhirDocumentBundle`
 * composes them into a `type: "document"` Bundle, and the FHIR REST routes wrap
 * them in a `type: "searchset"` Bundle. The coding logic has exactly one home,
 * so the document export and the REST face can never drift apart.
 *
 * No FHIR SDK, no `@types/fhir` — narrow hand-rolled interfaces only
 * (`../types`), matching the project's "hand-rolled over the documented wire"
 * convention. All text is escaped plain text; never user-supplied HTML
 * (no markdown library, no `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`).
