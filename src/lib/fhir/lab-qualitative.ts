/**
 * v1.18.9 — qualitative lab result → SNOMED CT concept (or honest text-only).
 *
 * A qualitative serology result ("negativ" / "positiv" / "nicht nachweisbar")
 * has no number, so its FHIR Observation carries a `valueCodeableConcept`
 * instead of a `valueQuantity`. This module maps common result terms onto a
 * small set of WELL-ESTABLISHED SNOMED CT qualifier-value concepts. The raw
 * recorded text ALWAYS rides `.text`; a coded `coding` is added only when the
 * term resolves CONFIDENTLY. When in doubt the result stays text-only — never
 * a fabricated code — mirroring the conservative stance of the `lab-loinc` and
 * `illness-snomed` mappers.
 *
 * Concepts (SNOMED CT International, qualifier value, REFERENCED not
 * redistributed per the licence):
 *   - 260385009  "Negative"     — every locale's `labs.form.qualNegative`
 *   - 10828004   "Positive"     — every locale's `labs.form.qualPositive`
 *   - 260415000  "Not detected" — nicht nachweisbar / not detected
 *   - 260373001  "Detected"     — nachweisbar / detected
 *
 * The negative and positive arms are DERIVED from `messages/<locale>.json`.
 * The lab form offers those two as quick picks and writes the label it
 * rendered, so what lands in the column is the bundle's own string —
 * "négatif", "negativo", "ujemny" — and matching it against a transcribed
 * English/German list meant four of the six shipped locales recorded a result
 * the export then could not code. Deriving means a new locale is coded the day
 * its bundle lands, with no edit here.
 *
 * The detected / not-detected arm is NOT derived, because the app ships no
 * string for it: those are terms a LAB printed and a person copied in. It
 * stays the hand-written English and German pair it has always been, and the
 * honest cost is that "non détecté" or "niewykrywalny" stay text-only. Coding
 * them would mean inventing clinical vocabulary in four languages nobody here
 * can check, and this module's own rule is that an unverified code is worse
 * than an honest `.text`. When those terms need coding, they need a quick pick
 * in the form and a bundle key — the same route the negative and positive arms
 * took.
 *
 * Borderline / grenzwertig is DELIBERATELY left text-only: the candidate
 * "Borderline" qualifier concept could not be confidently verified. Its bundle
 * key is therefore read by nothing here, on purpose. Any unrecognised term
 * likewise stays text-only.
 *
 * SERVER-ONLY: the derived index reads every shipped message bundle. Its one
 * caller is the FHIR exporter, which runs on the server.
 *
