/**
 * Whose profile the dashboard's client-side band fallback is allowed to use.
 *
 * The fallback draws reference bands — blood-pressure targets, the weight
 * range, every shaded chart zone — from the profile the page already holds,
 * so that charts are not blank for the frames before the server-resolved
 * bands arrive. That profile comes from `/api/auth/me`, an actor surface, so
 * under an account switch it describes the DELEGATE while the charts underneath
 * carry the OWNER's readings. A band is a claim about the person whose numbers
 * it shades; borrowing one from the person looking is the same wrong-record
 * paint the RSC prefetch already had to be taught to avoid, and it is quieter,
 * because a shaded zone looks exactly as authoritative either way.
 *
 * These assert the emptiness has TEETH: the same profile that produces a real
 * band unswitched must produce none switched, so an implementation that
 * returned its input regardless fails on the second half of every case rather
 * than on a shape check.
 *
 * Mutation checks, run:
 *   - `return profile;` unconditionally in `viewerBandProfile` → the three
 *     switched cases go red, printing the delegate's own BP target numbers as
 *     the value that reached the band.
