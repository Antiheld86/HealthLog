/**
 * Nothing leaves the wide-event builder unscrubbed.
 *
 * `setError` and `setHttp` have always scrubbed. `addMeta` and
 * `addExternalCall` did not, which made them a trusted sink by accident: the
 * finished event is JSON-stringified whole to stdout and the log store, so a
 * string placed in meta is as visible as one placed in an error message.
 *
 * Two real feeds exploited that gap. A Telegram request timeout put the full
 * request URL — which embeds the bot token — into `external_calls[].error`. And
 * the AI provider chain fed upstream error bodies into meta, so a gateway that
 * echoes the offending request on a 400 echoed prompt content.
 *
 * These tests fail on the previous code.
