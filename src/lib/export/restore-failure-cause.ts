/**
 * Why the database refused a restore transaction, as a cause an operator can
 * act on.
 *
 * Every refusal used to read the same way: "the database refused the restore
 * part-way, the server log names the error". A statement cancelled by the
 * timeout, a constraint the file broke, a disk that filled up and a
 * connection that dropped all look alike from the console, and each needs a
 * different next step (#1031). The cause is read from the SQLSTATE the driver
 * reports, or from Prisma's own code where the refusal is Prisma's, and never
 * from the message text, which can quote the rows involved.
