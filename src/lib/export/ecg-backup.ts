/**
 * The ECG strips, with both backup ends in one file.
 *
 * Same arrangement as `reminders-backup.ts`, `visits-backup.ts` and
 * `coach-backup.ts`, for the same reason: a reader asking "is this carried at
 * both ends?" answers it here, and a reader who greps only the restore ROUTE
 * gets a false negative because the route delegates.
 *
 * One model rides. Its register entry read "ECG traces and their rhythm
 * classification. The originating device may still hold them, but a
 * self-hoster who exported and wiped has nothing to re-sync from." That is the
 * whole case: a watch keeps a strip only as long as the phone beside it does,
 * and the Withings signal id stops resolving the moment the connection is
 * revoked.
 *
 * ## The trace and the verdict are different losses
 *
 * A recording is three things at once: WHEN a heart was recorded, WHAT the
 * device concluded about the rhythm, and the micro-volt series behind that
 * conclusion. A restore that returned the row with a defaulted
 * `rhythmClassification` would hand back a strip nobody has read a verdict off,
 * and a restore that returned it with a defaulted `recordedAt` would hand back
 * a strip that belongs to no day. Both are carried verbatim, and both are
 * asserted in `tests/integration/backup-round-trip.test.ts` rather than counted.
 *
 * ## The waveform follows the note contract, with one exception
 *
 * A disaster-recovery payload carries the stored ciphertext verbatim as base64,
 * because the same instance's key reads it back unchanged. A portable export
 * decrypts it, because a portable export exists to be readable by the person
 * who owns it, exactly as it already decrypts medication notes and mood notes.
 *
 * The exception is what happens when a strip cannot be decrypted at all — a row
 * written under a key the instance has since dropped. The Coach substitutes a
 * placeholder sentence for a turn in that state, because the other nine hundred
 * turns are still the person's and a thrown error would cost them all of it.
 * There is no placeholder for a waveform: `waveformEncrypted` is a required
 * column, so the choice is between writing a recording that describes a strip
 * nothing can draw and leaving it out. The unreadable recording is left OUT of
 * a portable file and a warning is raised on the wide event, so the number of
 * strips in the file is the number of strips that can be shown. A
 * disaster-recovery payload never decrypts and is therefore never affected.
 *
 * ## The one reference that needs care
 *
 * `measurementId` addresses the IRREGULAR_RHYTHM_NOTIFICATION event row the
 * strip was filed against, and unlike the Coach's `sourceConversationId` it is
 * a REAL foreign key. A value pointing at nothing does not quietly stop meaning
 * anything here: it violates the constraint and rolls the WHOLE restore back,
 * which hands the operator an empty account over one dangling id. That is not
 * hypothetical in this section — a portable export omits soft-deleted
 * measurements, so a strip filed against a measurement the account has since
 * deleted names a row the file does not carry.
 *
 * So the reference is resolved against the measurements the restore actually
 * wrote, and a miss is NULLED and reported rather than written. Nulling rather
 * than dropping is deliberate: the strip is the record, the event row is a
 * cross-reference, and losing the recording to save the pointer would be the
 * wrong way round.
