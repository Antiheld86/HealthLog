/**
 * Two models that travel in a disaster-recovery file and deliberately not in a
 * portable one, for two entirely different reasons.
 *
 * Everywhere else in this directory the split between the two export purposes
 * is about ENCODING: a portable file decrypts prose for the person who owns it,
 * a disaster-recovery file carries the ciphertext their own instance can read
 * back. Here the split is about whether the row should leave the instance at
 * all. That is a different kind of decision and it is worth stating plainly
 * rather than leaving a reader to infer it from a missing key.
 *
 * ## The screeners
 *
 * `MentalHealthAssessment` holds completed WHO-5, PHQ and GAD administrations.
 * The per-item answers live in `responsesEncrypted`, and for PHQ-9 that blob
 * contains item 9, the question about thoughts of being better off dead or of
 * hurting oneself. The schema comment says it outright: the item-9 raw value
 * lives ONLY there.
 *
 * The application already draws a line around that blob. It keeps
 * `item9Flagged` as a coarse boolean precisely so the history view can
 * re-surface crisis resources WITHOUT decrypting anything. Following the
 * instance's own line was the intent here: carry the administration as the
 * history view sees it, leave the answers encrypted.
 *
 * The schema settles it more firmly than that. `responsesEncrypted` is `Bytes`
 * and NOT NULL, so there is no honest half-row to write: a portable file with
 * no ciphertext could not restore an administration even if it wanted to. The
 * choice is the whole row or nothing, and a plaintext JSON file sitting in
 * somebody's downloads folder is the wrong home for that answer. So the whole
 * row rides only in a disaster-recovery file, and the portable file SAYS it
 * does not carry them rather than reporting an account with no screeners.
 *
 * ## The consent receipts
 *
 * `ConsentReceipt` is not sensitive in the same way. Its problem is that a
 * consent is given to an OPERATOR, not to a file. The coverage register raised
 * this itself, filed as "arguably belongs with the instance rather than the
 * account", and the argument holds: a receipt restored onto a different
 * instance asserts an agreement that instance's operator never obtained, with
 * a signature timestamp to make it look settled.
 *
 * A disaster-recovery file goes back to the same instance and the same
 * operator, so the consent it records still stands. A portable file can land
 * anywhere. So the receipts travel in the first and not in the second, and
 * again the file says so.
 *
 * ## What both of these are NOT
 *
 * Neither is an id-remap problem, an ordering problem, or unbuilt work. Both
 * hang off the user directly with no reference to anything else, so a future
 * reader looking for the reason they sat on the register will not find it in
 * the code. It is here.
