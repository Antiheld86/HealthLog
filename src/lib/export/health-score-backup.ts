/**
 * The stored health score days, with both backup ends in one file.
 *
 * `HealthScoreRecord` looks derived and is not. The live computation answers
 * for today from today's rows, so a day whose readings have since been
 * corrected, re-synced or simply extended cannot be recomputed as it stood;
 * the row is the only copy of the number the account actually saw. Classifying
 * it `DERIVED` and leaving it out would produce a restore that comes back with
 * a blank history and reports success, which is the shape of defect the
 * nutrient day totals, the custom mood tags and the custom cycle symptoms each
 * shipped in turn.
 *
 * The builder and the restore live together deliberately, the way
 * `intraday-profile-backup.ts` and `src/lib/cycle/backup.ts` do: a reader
 * asking "is this carried at both ends?" answers it in one file, and a reader
 * who greps only the restore ROUTE gets a false negative, because the route
 * delegates.
 *
 * Nothing here is encrypted, so there is no portable/disaster-recovery split
 * on the values. The only difference between the two purposes is identity: a
 * canonical disaster-recovery payload carries the row id and its timestamps so
 * the row comes back as itself, a portable export carries the day alone.
