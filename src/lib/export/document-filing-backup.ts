/**
 * What a stored document was filed against, and what was read out of it, with
 * both backup ends in one file.
 *
 * Same arrangement as `coach-backup.ts`, `reminders-backup.ts` and
 * `vaccinations-backup.ts`, for the same reason: a reader asking "is this
 * carried at both ends?" answers it here, and a reader who greps only the
 * restore ROUTE gets a false negative because the route delegates.
 *
 * Two models ride, and they are the two halves of the same sentence about a
 * document. `DocumentConditionLink` says which conditions a page belongs to.
 * `ExtractedFact` says what the extraction pass transcribed out of it, with the
 * span it came from. Both sat on the coverage-pending register, where the
 * entries read "a restored vault is unsorted" and "re-derivable only by
 * re-running the extraction against a provider, at the operator's cost".
 *
 * ## The state on a fact is worth more than the fact
 *
 * `status`, `needsReview` and the pair `committedRecordId` /
 * `committedRecordType` are the record of a DECISION a person already made:
 * this fact was reviewed, approved, and committed to that lab result. Every one
 * of them has a schema default that reads as "nobody has looked at this yet"
 * (`PENDING`, `needsReview: true`, both commitment columns NULL), so a restore
 * that let them default hands back the same rows with their history erased.
 *
 * That is not only lost history. `POST /api/documents/inbound/[id]/confirm`
 * accepts a decision only on a `PENDING` fact and commits it through the normal
 * field-by-field create — so a fact that comes back PENDING is offered for
 * review a second time, and approving it writes a SECOND lab result, condition
 * or medication for a reading the account already has. The count of facts would
 * be right, the vault would look right, and the structured store would start
 * doubling. So the four columns are carried and restored verbatim, and asserted
 * by name in the round trip.
 *
 * ## Two references that behave very differently
 *
 * `documentId` is a real foreign key on both models, and `episodeId` is one on
 * the link. A value that cannot resolve does not quietly stop meaning
 * something: it aborts the transaction and costs the operator the WHOLE
 * restore. So the builder carries a row only when both of its ends are
 * carried — a document tombstoned out of the file takes its filings and its
 * facts with it — and the restore still checks against what it actually wrote
 * and drops what it cannot place, because a hand-edited or truncated file is
 * the case the write-time filter cannot cover.
 *
 * `committedRecordId` is the opposite: a bare id column with no relation
 * declared, pointing into one of three different tables depending on
 * `committedRecordType`. Nothing in the database refuses a value that points at
 * nothing, which makes it more dangerous rather than less. It is resolved
 * against the lab results, condition episodes and medications the restore has
 * just written, and a value that resolves to nothing is nulled TOGETHER with
 * its type and reported — a fact that still claimed to have been committed
 * somewhere, with no somewhere, would send a reader looking for a row that is
 * not there.
 *
 * ## Ciphertext follows the contract every other encrypted column here uses
 *
 * A disaster-recovery payload carries the stored bytes verbatim as base64,
 * because the same instance's key reads them back unchanged. A portable export
 * carries the decrypted JSON, because a portable export exists to be readable
 * by the person who owns it, exactly as it already decrypts medication notes,
 * mood notes and document summaries.
 *
 * The portable arm of the RESTORE is there for the reader's file, not for a
 * path this release can reach: a fact cannot exist without a document, and the
 * route refuses a portable file that carries any document ahead of the wipe
 * because document ciphertext is not in it. It is written the same way as the
 * coach turns rather than as a special case, so the next person reading either
 * file finds one contract instead of two.
