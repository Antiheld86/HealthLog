/**
 * Document-class AI provider resolution (governance fix, oauth-investigation
 * SYNTHESIS §1).
 *
 * A three-audit investigation found that for uploaded medical DOCUMENTS the
 * app-wide provider chain is the wrong default: `codex` (the
 * ChatGPT-subscription OAuth backend) sits at chain priority 1, ahead of BYOK
 * and local, and OpenAI's consumer policy allows training on that content by
 * default. HealthLog is privacy-first, so a scanned discharge letter must NOT
 * default to the train-by-default backend.
 *
 * The fix is scoped to the DOCUMENT class only — Coach / insights keep the
 * cost-first app-wide order untouched. This module reprioritises the resolved
 * provider chain for the vault's AI surfaces (suggest / summary / extract /
 * index / reindex / backfill):
 *
 *   local (no egress) → BYOK no-train API (openai / anthropic) → operator's
 *   admin key → codex (ChatGPT-subscription OAuth) LAST, as an explicit,
 *   consented opt-in.
 *
 * The reorder only decides WHICH configured provider is preferred; it never
 * invents a provider. The per-egress vendor-blind UI notice sits on top of
 * this order — the reorder keeps codex from being the silent default.
 *
 * The pick is also the document class's wire: every read of a stored document
 * resolves its provider here, the vault routes and the background jobs alike,
 * so this is where the `documentAi` capability is asked again, about the
 * provider actually picked, immediately before anything is sent. A switch the
 * operator turned off after a job was enqueued stops the job here, and an
 * external pick without an extraction consent receipt never reaches its
 * provider. The document class is the `documentAi` capability; there is no
 * other key a caller could pass, so the check is built in rather than taken
 * as an argument.
