/**
 * Import source keys (#1038): where a `(sourceSystem, sourceId)` pair sent by
 * an importer already lands in a person's vault.
 *
 * A key can be held in three places, checked in this order:
 *
 *  1. the document row itself (`InboundDocument.sourceSystem/sourceId`), live
 *     or tombstoned — the key the document was stored under;
 *  2. `DocumentSourceAlias` — a further key an import sent for bytes that were
 *     already stored, so the upload answered with the existing document;
 *  3. `DocumentImportKey` — a key whose document the purge has removed.
 *
 * The first two resolve to a document (live → duplicate, tombstoned →
 * deleted); the third only to "deleted". The upload route, the lookup route
 * and the document picker all ask here, so they cannot disagree about what a
 * key means.
 *
 * v1.39.3 — a key also names its instance (`sourceInstance`, the origin of
 * the Paperless-ngx or Papra it came from): id 123 on one Paperless and id
 * 123 on another are different documents. A null on either side is a
 * wildcard, so nothing stored before the column existed is forgotten:
 *
 *   - a key stored without an instance (a v1.39.2 import, an older script, a
 *     workflow that does not send one) matches a lookup for any instance of
 *     its system;
 *   - a lookup without an instance matches a key stored for any instance.
 *
 * Where both an exact and a wildcard match exist, the exact one wins.
