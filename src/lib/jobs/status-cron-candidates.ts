/**
 * Shared user discovery for the nightly 02:xx per-metric status crons
 * (general / blood-pressure / weight / pulse / bmi / medication-
 * compliance / mood).
 *
 * Before this module each cron iterated EVERY user row: accounts that
 * disabled the coach surface (`disableCoach`) and operator-disabled
 * deployments (assistant kill-switch) still paid one generator pass per
 * user per night, and users the 04:30 `insight-pregenerate` cron was
 * going to re-warm anyway were generated twice.
 *
 * Division of nightly labour (documented here once, referenced by the
 * handlers):
 *
 *   - 02:xx status crons → users the 04:30 `insight-pregenerate` pass will
 *     not reach: a comprehensive cache fresher than `PREGENERATE_STALE_MS`,
 *     so that pass skips them, while their per-status notes still age out
 *     daily and only these crons re-fill them.
 *   - 04:30 insight-pregenerate → the rest: users with a comprehensive cache
 *     older than `PREGENERATE_STALE_MS`. That pass warms every per-status
 *     note whenever `statusText` is available for the user, whatever became
 *     of the briefing, so a 02:xx generation for them would be redone two
 *     hours later.
 *
 * Cheap gates, in SQL and in order (the per-user `statusText` capability in
 * each handler, and the chokepoint behind it, are what decide):
 *   1. The operator's `insightStatus` switch (master applied). Off, the whole
 *      pass is empty.
 *   2. The person's AI analysis switch (the `insights` module). Someone who
 *      turned it off gets no nightly generation. Hiding the Coach
 *      (`disableCoach`) no longer plays a part: it hides the Coach and nothing
 *      else.
 *   3. The pregenerate-candidate skip described above, only while the
 *      `briefing` switch is on; when it is off the 04:30 pass no-ops, so the
 *      02:xx crons keep covering everyone.
