/**
 * `ImportJob.exportedAt` — the worker end of the wiring.
 *
 * The parse side is proved behaviourally in
 * `src/lib/measurements/__tests__/import-apple-health-export.test.ts`:
 * the parser hands the archive's own stamp to `onExportDate`. What that
 * cannot show is whether anything persists it. The column, the status
 * endpoint that returns it and the published contract that requires it
 * all existed for a year while the one line that would produce the value
 * was a `return`, so the half of the pipe worth pinning is this one.
 *
 * Source-shaped rather than run-shaped: driving the worker needs a real
 * `export.zip`, a queue and a database, which the ECG contract test
 * beside this one already declines to do for the same reason.
