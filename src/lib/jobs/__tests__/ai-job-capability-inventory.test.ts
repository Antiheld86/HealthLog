/**
 * Every background job that writes model text resolves its AI capability.
 *
 * The rule for jobs (design: "AI optional"): a worker resolves its capability
 * for the user before it builds a snapshot and skips with a `.skipped`
 * annotation when the answer is no; the provider chokepoint re-checks at the
 * wire. This freezes the first half as a reference: each file below must call
 * the named gate with the named capability key.
 *
 * It proves a reference exists, not that it sits before the snapshot or on
 * every branch. The integration suite (`tests/integration/ai-optional-jobs.test.ts`)
 * runs each worker under the refusing states with a provider spy and is what
 * proves behaviour.
