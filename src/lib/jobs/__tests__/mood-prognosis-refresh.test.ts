/**
 * The nightly mood-forecast rebuild.
 *
 * Three properties, each of which fails silently if it breaks:
 *
 *   1. **The sweep visits accounts that hold rows, not only accounts that
 *      qualify.** An account that deleted its entries drops out of the
 *      eligibility half of the cohort, and if that were the whole cohort it
 *      would keep last month's forecast forever, under whatever date the last
 *      pass stamped on it. Nothing on the surface would say so.
 *   2. **A refusal clears.** Below the threshold, module off, no pattern — all
 *      three leave the account with no rows rather than with stale ones.
 *   3. **One account's bad data costs one account.** The pass counts the
 *      failure and carries on; only an all-accounts failure fails the job.
 *
 * The cohort query and the module gate are mocked, which is what makes the
 * decision path testable without a container. The arithmetic underneath has
 * its own tests, and the whole thing is exercised end to end against real
 * Postgres in `tests/integration/mood-prognosis-ladder.test.ts`.
