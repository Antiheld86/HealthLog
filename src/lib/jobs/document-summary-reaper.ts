/**
 * Hourly reaper for document-summary rows stuck on PENDING.
 *
 * PENDING promises the reader "a job will resolve this" — and the enqueue
 * side only claims it once a pg-boss job genuinely exists. But a job can
 * still die past its retry budget (worker crash, provider outage outliving
 * retryLimit:2), and a soft-deleted-then-restored document can outlive the
 * queue row entirely. Nothing then ever writes a terminal state, so the
 * detail sheet says "wird generiert" forever and the OpenAPI-exported state
 * keeps exporting the lie.
 *
 * Two ends close it (both against the same TTL):
 *   - read-time: `serialiseDocumentDetail` degrades a stale PENDING to
 *     UNAVAILABLE, so the very next detail open is honest;
 *   - this sweep: persists the same heal, so list chips, exports and any
 *     other reader converge too. Mirrors the orphan-ImportJob reconcile
 *     precedent (a stuck in-flight marker must converge to a visible
 *     terminal state within a couple of ticks).
 *
 * UNAVAILABLE is the honest terminal here — "could not produce" — and the
 * detail view offers the manual generate button in that state, so the user
 * regains the action a dead PENDING was hiding. A job that does eventually
 * run after the heal still wins: the summary writer flips any non-READY
 * state to READY when it lands.
