/**
 * Nightly refresh of the `CyclePrediction` forecast rows.
 *
 * The cycle-reminder cron scans `CyclePrediction` to decide who is due a
 * period-soon or fertile-soon push. Until v1.35.3 those rows were written
 * only as a side effect of `GET /api/cycle/calendar`, so an account that
 * tracked its cycle but never opened the calendar page was scanned against a
 * forecast made from whatever its data looked like the last time somebody
 * looked — or was never scanned at all. Moving the write here makes the
 * reminder's input a function of the account's data instead of its browsing.
 *
 * Cohort: accounts that hold a `CycleProfile` with prediction not explicitly
 * off, resolved through the same two-layer cycle gate the routes use, so an
 * operator-disabled module refreshes nothing. Per-account failures are
 * counted and the pass continues; a pass that failed for every account it
 * touched fails the job so the operator sees it.
 *
 * Runs at 04:20 Europe/Berlin, after the 03:xx retention block. The forecast
 * moves on a day scale and the reminder windows are days wide, so a fixed
 * server-side hour is close enough for every timezone the cohort spans.
