/**
 * Nightscout hourly poll-cohort sync handler (v1.17.0).
 *
 * Poll-only: Nightscout has no outbound webhook to HealthLog, so the single
 * hourly cron tick carries no `userId` and the handler iterates every user with
 * a configured instance, re-syncing each via `syncUserNightscout`. One user's
 * unreachable instance never starves the rest of the cohort — a per-user error
 * is warned and the pass continues. The shared control flow lives in
 * `./poll-cohort`; reminder-worker.ts owns the queue name, cron schedule, and
 * boss.work registration.
