/**
 * v1.11.0 — WHOOP per-resource sync payload. Two enqueue paths feed each
 * WHOOP sync queue:
 *
 *   1. Webhook (`recovery.updated` / `sleep.updated` / `workout.updated`) —
 *      payload carries `userId` and (v1.16.16) the `resourceId`; the handler
 *      does a targeted fetch-by-id refresh of that single record.
 *   2. Cron — payload has no `userId`; the handler iterates every WHOOP
 *      connection and re-syncs each collection, catching dropped webhook
 *      deliveries. Cycle has no webhook, so its cron is the sole driver.
 *
 * A webhook job that carries a `userId` but no `resourceId` (a legacy in-flight
 * job, or a delivery that omitted the id) falls back to the per-user collection
 * walk rather than touching every connection.

 *   - A webhook job with a `userId` but no `resourceId` runs the per-user
 *     collection `syncFn`.
 *   - A cron tick (no `userId` on any job) walks every connection's collection.
 *
 * One user's parked-at-reauth state never starves the rest of the cohort.
 *
 * The pass is what the outcome judges: a per-user failure is that user's
 * problem, recorded on their integration ledger and counted as `users_failed`,
 * not a queue-wide failure that would retry the whole cohort.
