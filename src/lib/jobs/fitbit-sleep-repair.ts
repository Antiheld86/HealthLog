/**
 * pg-boss queue + boot-time one-shot sleep duplicate repair for Fitbit
 * connections. Modelled on the Google Health sleep repair
 * (`src/lib/jobs/google-health-sleep-repair.ts`) and the self-converging
 * backfill: a discovery query enqueues one job per connection not yet repaired,
 * and the pass is idempotent across reboots (the predicate
 * `sleep_repaired_at IS NULL` drops a connection once its repair finishes).
 *
 * Why: the earlier Fitbit sleep externalId carried a positional segment index
 * and the stage label, so every re-score of a night minted fresh keys, stranded
 * the previous scoring's rows, and over-counted the night total. The fix
 * (`replaceStaleFitbitSleep` plus the stable segment-start key) makes any
 * RE-READ night self-heal, and the incremental 24 h overlap heals recent nights
 * — but historical nights keep their duplicates until re-read. This job forces
 * one bounded sleep-history re-read per connection so the replace-by-window
 * collapses each night once.
 *
 * BOUNDED WALK: unlike the Google repair (whose API pages the whole history),
 * the classic Fitbit sleep endpoint caps each request at 30 days and the
 * per-user budget is tight, so the repair passes an explicit
 * `start = now − FITBIT_BACKFILL_DAYS` — the same 365-day horizon the backfill
 * documents as the recovery limit, about a dozen requests per account. Nights
 * older than that keep their old keys and any duplicates already recorded; they
 * can no longer accrue new ones, because Fitbit does not re-score year-old
 * nights. The explicit `start` is REQUIRED: `syncUserSleep`'s own default is
 * only 30 days.
 *
 * Watermark-safe by construction: `syncUserSleep` never reads or stamps
 * `lastSyncedAt` — `markSynced` is owned by the orchestrator (`syncUserFitbit`),
 * which this job does not call.
 *
 * The queue name MUST be registered in `allQueues` in
 * `src/lib/jobs/reminder/register-integration-sync.ts` or pg-boss never
 * provisions it and the boot enqueue silently never drains (the v1.4.37
 * dead-queue class).

/**
 * Per-user repair handler. Re-reads the bounded sleep history for one account —

 * and the natural-key rescue re-keys the survivors — then stamps
 * `sleepRepairedAt` so the discovery query drops it. Idempotent: the per-segment
 * upserts are key-stable and the replace-by-window clears stale copies, so a
 * re-run (e.g. a reboot mid-walk) converges rather than duplicating. Does NOT
 * move `lastSyncedAt`.
 *
 * Verdict-gated: `syncUserSleep` swallows fetch/write hard failures into the
 * ambient hard-fail ledger (returning a count either way), so the repair runs it
 * inside its own ledger scope — the same mechanism `syncUserFitbit` uses for its
 * cycle verdict — and stamps `sleepRepairedAt` ONLY on a clean run. A hard
 * fetch/write failure THROWS so pg-boss retries; a dead token (parked
 * connection, missing credentials, failed refresh) is NOT clean but does not
 * throw — retrying a dead grant burns the retry budget on the same no-op. It
 * returns WITHOUT stamping instead: the boot discovery re-enqueues the account
 * on the next boot, and the stamp lands after a reconnect.
