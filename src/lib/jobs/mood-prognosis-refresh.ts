/**
 * Nightly rebuild of the mood forecast rows.
 *
 * **This is not an AI surface.** A ridge regression over a dozen standardised
 * columns is arithmetic: no provider, no key, no egress, no consent gate. It
 * is stated here because the shape of the feature invites the assumption in
 * both directions — nobody should wire a consent check that does not apply,
 * and nobody should assume one exists where none is needed. If a later change
 * narrates this forecast through a language model, THAT call site inherits
 * `ai-consent-enforcement-guard.test.ts` and has to declare its surface.
 *
 * **This file is the only writer of `MoodPrediction`**, held there by
 * `src/__tests__/mood-prediction-write-surface-guard.test.ts`. The reason is
 * the product rule: a day carries the person's own rating and the value their
 * past days imply, the two are never merged, and the second one is not
 * editable. A route that wrote this table would make it editable. The cycle
 * module learned the other half of the same lesson the expensive way — a
 * forecast written as a side effect of opening a page is a function of
 * browsing rather than of data.
 *
 * **A pass replaces; it never accumulates.** Every account it touches ends the
 * pass holding exactly the rows this run wrote, or none. An account that has
 * fallen below the threshold, switched the module off, or stopped showing a
 * pattern is left with nothing rather than with last week's answer under a
 * fresh-looking date. That is the stale rule, chosen over marking rows
 * superseded because a derived row is cheap to rebuild and a superseded row is
 * one more state every reader has to handle correctly.
 *
 * Runs at 04:35 Europe/Berlin. The 03:xx block is retention; 04:10 is the
 * document purge, 04:20 the cycle forecast, 04:25 the achievement sweep, 04:30
 * the insight pre-generation, and 04:45/50/55 the recovery, stress and strain
 * scores. 04:35 is free, and it sits after the inputs this job reads have
 * settled. (04:40 is not free: the geo backfill runs at `40 * * * *`.)
