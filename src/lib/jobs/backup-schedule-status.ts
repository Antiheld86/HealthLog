/**
 * Whether the weekly backup is actually still happening, in two facts.
 *
 * The pass stopped producing a new copy and nothing said so for a month and a
 * half. Everything that could have told the operator was either invisible or
 * short-lived: the handler's own error never ran (the job was killed, not
 * thrown), `recordError()` increments an unnamed counter, and the admin status
 * page's failing-queue panel only looks back 72 hours — which for a weekly
 * queue means a permanent failure is on screen three days in seven. The backups
 * page itself showed a perfectly ordinary row with a perfectly ordinary
 * timestamp, because a 46-day-old copy looks exactly like a fresh one until you
 * read the date.
 *
 * So the surface carries both legs, and neither is derived from the other:
 *
 *   - the AGE of the newest scheduled copy, which never ages out of any
 *     retention window and would have caught this on the second missed Sunday;
 *   - the terminal state of the last scheduled RUN, which is the only place the
 *     reason ("job timed out") is written down at all.
 *
 * Manual uploads are excluded by the shape of the input: the caller passes only
 * the scheduled rows, so an admin's ad-hoc upload cannot make a dead cron look
 * alive.
