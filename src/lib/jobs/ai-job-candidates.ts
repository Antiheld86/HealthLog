/**
 * Cheap SQL prefilters for the AI crons.
 *
 * Every AI job resolves its capability per user (`aiCapabilityForJob`) before
 * it builds a snapshot, and the provider chokepoint re-checks it at the wire.
 * Those are the answers that count. What this file adds is the cheap part in
 * front of them: people who switched a module off are dropped from the
 * candidate query itself, so a nightly pass over the instance does not load
 * their capability inputs one by one only to be told no.
 *
 * `modulePreferencesJson` is a DISABLED allowlist: a module is off only when
 * its key holds JSON `false`. Selecting the "off" set is NULL-safe by
 * construction (an absent key, a NULL column or a non-object value never
 * compares equal to `false`), which a negated JSON-path filter would not be.
