/**
 * v1.17.1 — one-shot sleep-timeline backfill for WHOOP + Withings.
 *
 * Two ingest-side stamp/shape fixes changed the stored sleep rows:
 *
 *  - WHOOP: the old mapper stamped all five per-stage DURATION totals on the
 *    one sleep-END instant (WHOOP v2 exposes no onset timestamps), so the
 *    hypnogram reconstructed every stage as a span touching the night's right
 *    edge — stacked, no clock times. The fix reconstructs an ordered,
 *    contiguous per-segment timeline with distinct `measuredAt` per segment and
 *    NEW indexed externalIds (`<sleep_id>:seg:<tag>:<i>`).
 *  - Withings: each segment was stamped with its START while every reader
 *    treats `measuredAt` as the END, shifting each night one segment-length
 *    earlier. The fix stamps the END.
 *
 * Both change the row's `measuredAt` (and, for WHOOP, the externalId), and the
 * unique index `(userId, type, measuredAt, source, sleepStage)` makes an
 * in-place UPDATE collision-prone. So the per-connection pass DELETES the
 * affected `SLEEP_DURATION` rows for that source, RE-SYNCS with the corrected
 * mapper (which re-folds the rollup tier in its tail), and stamps
 * `sleepTimelineBackfillAt` so the discovery query drops the connection.
 *
 * Idempotent across reboots: the discovery predicate is
 * `sleep_timeline_backfill_at IS NULL`, and a completed pass stamps the marker.
 * A reboot mid-pass re-runs delete + re-sync from scratch — the re-sync upserts
 * are key-stable, so the result converges.
 *
 * Modelled on `whoop-backfill.ts` / `fitbit-backfill.ts`. The queue name MUST
 * be registered in `allQueues` in `src/lib/jobs/reminder-worker.ts` or pg-boss
 * never provisions it and the boot enqueue silently never drains (the v1.4.37
 * dead-queue class).
