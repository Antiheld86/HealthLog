 * v1.12.0 — pg-boss queue + boot-time self-converging backfill for newly
 * connected Fitbit / Google Health accounts. Modelled on the WHOOP backfill
 * (`src/lib/jobs/whoop-backfill.ts`): a discovery query enqueues one job per
 * connection that has NOT yet been backfilled, and the pass is idempotent
 * across reboots (the predicate `backfill_completed_at IS NULL` drops a
 * connection once its backfill finishes).
 *
 * The queue name MUST be registered in `allQueues` in
 * `src/lib/jobs/reminder-worker.ts` or pg-boss never provisions it and the boot
 * enqueue silently never drains (the v1.4.37 dead-queue class).

 * marker over a partial walk would freeze the history gap in forever and the
 * configured `retryLimit` would be dead code. A connection parked at

 * just burn the retry budget on the same no-op: return WITHOUT stamping — the
 * boot discovery re-enqueues the account on the next boot, and the stamp lands
