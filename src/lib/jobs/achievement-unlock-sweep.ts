/**
 * Nightly sweep that pins newly unlocked achievements.
 *
 * An unlock date is derived from the account's own history, so the badge
 * grid renders correctly whether or not a `UserAchievement` row exists — the
 * row is what makes the DATE durable once the underlying rows move, and it
 * is what the backup carries ("the date is the part that cannot be
 * recovered").
 *
 * Until v1.35.3 the only thing that wrote those rows was
 * `GET /api/gamification/achievements`. That made a durable record a side
 * effect of somebody looking at a page: an account that earned a badge and
 * never opened the app pinned nothing, and a read carried an INSERT that an
 * MCP-audience read token would have been admitted on the moment any route
 * declared a narrow scope. The evaluation is unchanged and still runs on the
 * read; only the persistence moved here, where it covers every account
 * rather than the ones that happened to look.
 *
 * The date written is the computed completion date, not the sweep's own
 * clock, so a badge pinned tonight and the same badge pinned a week from now
 * carry the identical timestamp. Running late costs nothing but exposure to
 * a data edit in between.
 *
 * Runs at 04:25 Europe/Berlin, after the cycle-prediction refresh (04:20).
