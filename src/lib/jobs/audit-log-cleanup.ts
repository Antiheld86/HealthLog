 * not be stored "longer than is necessary".
 *
 * Default retention is 365 days (configurable via AUDIT_LOG_RETENTION_DAYS
 * env). Rows older than the cutoff are deleted in a single bulk
 * `deleteMany`; runs daily via pg-boss.

 * Every index on the table leads with `user_id` or `action`, so the predicate
 * had none and the statement planned a sequential scan plus index maintenance
 * on every removed row. Past the 60-second `statement_timeout` that aborts and
 * rolls back, and the next night repeats it against the same rows — a
 * retention window that can never close on an instance that has accumulated
 * enough of them. Migration 0277 adds the `created_at` index; the batching
 * keeps any single statement bounded regardless.
