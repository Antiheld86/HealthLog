/**
 * The manual-sync trigger body, read once for every provider.
 *
 * Four sync routes each carried their own copy of this:
 *
 *     let fullSync = false;
 *     try {
 *       const raw = await request.text();
 *       if (raw.length > 64 * 1024) return apiError(…, 413);
 *       const body = JSON.parse(raw);
 *       fullSync = body?.fullSync === true;
 *     } catch {
 *       // no body provided -> default incremental sync
 *     }
 *
 * The comment is only true for one of the three cases that reach the catch. An
 * absent body means an incremental run, and that is the documented and used
 * shape. But a body that is present and unparseable, and a body that is present
 * and carries `"fullSync": "true"` as a string, both landed in the same place:
 * `fullSync = false`, a 200, and a response that reads to the client as a
 * successful incremental sync. A caller could ask for full history, get a typo
 * wrong, and be told it worked.
 *
 * This separates the three. Absent still means incremental. Present and
 * unparseable is a 400, present and failing the schema is a 422 with the
 * multi-issue envelope the rest of the surface uses. No caller that sends
 * nothing, `{}`, or a well-formed `{ "fullSync": <bool> }` sees any change; the
 * only requests that now fail are the ones that were already being misread.
