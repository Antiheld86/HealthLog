/**
 * Server-side sync-health verdict — the one place liveness is decided.
 *
 * The ledger (`src/lib/integrations/status.ts`) records what the last sync
 * attempt DID. It has no way to express what an attempt is no longer doing:
 * `error_transient` documents itself as "the sync entry-point still attempts on
 * the next run", yet a row can sit at that value for a month while nothing runs
 * at all — and nothing anywhere read the AGE of `lastAttemptAt`, so the state
 * was unrepresentable. A provider that had stopped even trying looked exactly
 * like one that was retrying every hour.
 *
 * This module derives the missing verdict as a read-side projection. It writes
 * nothing, adds no cron, and cannot desynchronise from the row it reads. The
 * status envelope computes it per entry from data it already has in hand (zero
 * additional queries) and every consumer — the Settings cards, the fallback
 * row, the MCP status tool — renders the same answer.
 *
 * The module is deliberately pure: no Prisma import, no I/O, `import type` only.
 * That keeps it importable from client components (the pill mapper reads the
 * verdict union) without dragging the database client into the browser bundle.
