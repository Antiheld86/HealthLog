/**
 * v1.12.1 — server-side consent gate before external-LLM PHI egress.
 *
 * The `ConsentReceipt` infrastructure (`latestActiveReceipt`,
 * `ai_full | ai_insights_only | ai_coach`, append-only audit trail) was built
 * but never enforced as a precondition: a direct API caller with a valid
 * bearer/cookie could trigger external-LLM processing of their own health
 * snapshot with no receipt on file. Consent was enforced client-side only.
 *
 * This guard closes that gap. Before the first external-provider call on a
 * SERVER-MANAGED path — i.e. the operator's global OpenAI key resolved via
 * `resolveAdminProvider` and tagged `admin-openai` in the chain — an active,
 * non-revoked receipt is required for the calling user.
 *
 * Scope, deliberately narrow (per the audit's fix sketch + the launch task):
 *   - GATED:   `admin-openai` — the operator's global key forwards the user's
 *              metrics to a third-party processor the user did not contract
 *              with directly. This is the egress consent law cares about.
 *   - UNGATED: a user's own BYOK key (`openai` / `anthropic`), their own
 *              ChatGPT OAuth account (`codex`), and the self-hosted `local`
 *              provider. These are the user's own egress to a processor they
 *              chose; the existing settings flow is the consent act there.
 *
 * The check fails CLOSED: a chain that COULD egress via the server-managed
 * key requires a receipt even when a BYOK provider sits ahead of it in the
 * chain, because the runner may cascade to the admin key on a primary
 * failure and we must not race that decision. A receipt of the surface's
 * mapped kind OR the superset `ai_full` grant satisfies the gate.

 * machine and stays ungated; EVERY external pick (codex, BYOK openai/anthropic,
 * the operator's admin key) requires an active extraction receipt
 * (`ai_extraction` or `ai_full`). The check itself runs through the capability
 * egress re-check (`aiEgressRefusal` in `@/lib/ai/capabilities/egress`), which
