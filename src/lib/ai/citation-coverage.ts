 * Reachability note. This module was written for `generateInsight()`, whose
 * only caller was `runWithFallback()` — and that had no production caller,
 * because every live surface routes through `runRawCompletionWithFallback`.
 * The coverage annotation therefore never executed: an audit surface that
 * implied enforcement it did not perform.
 *
 * v1.30.24 kept the logic and widened the input type to the structural shape
 * both payloads share, so the comprehensive post-parse step could call it and
 * the admin quality dashboard could see real data. The dead wrapper and chain
 * runner around it have since been removed outright, so this module now has
 * exactly one caller and it is a live one.
 *
 * Observational by design: an uncited normative recommendation is an
 * annotation, never a parse failure. It is a METRIC, not a gate — the citation
 * ENFORCEMENT that once sat beside it is gone rather than dormant, so nothing
 * here should be read as withholding output.
 */

/**
 * The minimum recommendation shape the coverage check needs. Both the strict

 * v1.4.16 phase B5a — citation-coverage post-validation.
 *
 * After the schema parse + cross-citation check pass, the wrapper
 * counts how many recommendations make a normative claim
 * ("target", "should", "normal range", "above", "below") and how
 * many of those carry a `referenceId` pointing into the curated
 * medical-reference bundle. The result lands as a Wide-Event meta
 * annotation so the admin AI quality dashboard can track coverage
 * over time.
 *
 * The check is observational only — a normative rec without a
 * referenceId is logged as a warning, never raised as a parse
 * failure. v1.4.16 phase B5c flips it to required for severity
 * >= "important".
 *
 * ## Why the keyword bank has six arms
 *
 * The recommendations are generated in the READER's language — the prompt is
 * built per locale and `screenInsightPayloadProse` screens the same prose
 * against the same locale. The bank was English plus German, so for a French,
 * Spanish, Italian or Polish reader every recommendation scored
 * non-normative: the annotation reported `normative: 0`, `uncited: 0`, and the
 * admin dashboard read that as perfect coverage rather than as no measurement
 * at all. A check that cannot fail is worse than no check, because it is
 * indistinguishable from a passing one.
 *
 * These words are NOT in `messages/*.json` — they are the model's own prose,
 * not app labels — so the derive-from-the-bundles shape that fits a UI label
 * does not apply here. The bank is hand-written, and the structural test
 * refuses to let a locale ship with an empty arm: adding a seventh language
 * fails the suite instead of silently reporting 0/0 for it.
 *
 * Matching policy: fold both sides through `foldForMatch` (case, accents,
 * hyphens, apostrophes) and require a LEADING word boundary while leaving the
 * tail free, so the LLM's inflections still hit ("targets", "should be",
 * "objectifs") without "sopra" firing inside the everyday Italian
 * "soprattutto".
