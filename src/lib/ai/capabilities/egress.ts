/**
 * The capability re-check at the wire.
 *
 * `requireAiCapability` answers at the top of a route, before anything is
 * picked. That is the refusal a client sees, but it is not the last word: a
 * route may pick its provider in its own order, and a job enqueued before the
 * operator turned a switch off runs long after any route answered. So every
 * place that hands input to a model (the document provider pick, the labs
 * scan, the medication extractor, the fenced document chat) asks again here,
 * with the provider it is about to send to, immediately before it sends.
 *
 * Two questions, both about the actual wire:
 *
 *   1. Is the capability still open for this record? Inside a request this is
 *      the request's own resolution (memoised per request, so the answer
 *      matches the one the route gave); outside a request it is the job's
 *      resolution for the record it names.
 *   2. Does sending to exactly these providers need a consent receipt, and is
 *      one active? Presence cannot answer this for a route that reads the
 *      chain in its own order, so the pick answers it here, from the same
 *      rule and the same receipt kinds the capability table declares.
 *
 * `no_provider` is never answered here: a caller that has a pick has a
 * provider, and one without a pick refuses with its own typed code.
