/**
 * The AI capability gates: how a route or a job asks whether it may call a
 * model, or serve text a model wrote.
 *
 *   - `requireAiCapability(key)`: AI action routes (they call a model or
 *     enqueue a job that will). Call it right after auth, before rate limits
 *     and body parsing; it throws `AiUnavailableError`, which `apiHandler`
 *     turns into the refusal envelope.
 *   - `getAiCapability(key)`: mixed reads that serve data plus optional model
 *     text. Never throws; returns the state so the route can null the model
 *     field and say why.
 *   - `aiCapabilityForJob(userId, key)`: workers, before they build a
 *     snapshot. No request context, so the record comes in as an argument and
 *     the authority is the worker's own.
 *
 * Data routes never import this file. A measurement, a score, a statistic or
 * a device record does not depend on AI.
 *
 * The refusal envelope keeps every code a shipped client branches on:
 *
 *   403 { data: null, error, meta: { errorCode, capability, reason, module? } }
 *
 *   operator_disabled         → `assistant.disabled.<switch>`, or
 *                               `module.disabled` + `meta.module` when the
 *                               operator's module availability closed it
 *   not_permitted_for_record  → `ai.record.notPermitted`
 *   module_disabled           → `module.disabled` + `meta.module`
 *   user_disabled             → `module.disabled` + `meta.module`
 *   no_provider               → the route's own typed code where a client
 *                               already reads one, otherwise
 *                               `ai.provider.none`; 422
 *   consent_required          → `consent.ai.required`
 *   check_failed              → `ai.unavailable`; 503
