/**
 * The doctor-visit summariser, and what it says when there is nothing to say.
 *
 * The MCP surfaces cannot ask a human, so they replay the owner's saved report
 * selection. An account that never saved one resolves to the empty selection
 * and the aggregator returns an empty payload — which has to read as "nothing
 * was recorded for this", not as a record whose every section happens to be
 * missing. The `{ present: false, reason }` sentinel is the same one the other
 * MCP reads use.
 *
 * Mutation checks:
 *   - make `present` unconditionally `true` again → "reports absence for an
 *     empty scope" goes red.
 *   - drop `data.bmi !== null` from the `hasContent` test → "counts a lone BMI
 *     figure as content" goes red.
