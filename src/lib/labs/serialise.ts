/**
 * v1.18.1 — server-authoritative lab-result DTO resolution.
 *
 * A lab row resolves its display name + unit + reference bounds in ONE place:
 *
 *  - If the row links a `Biomarker` (`biomarkerId` set), the canonical name,
 *    unit, and reference bounds come FROM THE BIOMARKER. The per-row legacy
 *    `analyte` / `unit` / `reference*` columns are ignored — they are stale
 *    historical truth at that point.
 *  - If the row is unlinked (legacy / pre-backfill), it falls back to its own
 *    free-text `analyte` / `unit` / `reference*` columns.
 *
 * On top of that the reading's OWN printed window wins. A lab report states
 * the range its method and device produce right beside the value, and that is
 * the window a physician evaluates against; the catalog band is the net for
 * readings that carry none. `resolveEffectiveReferenceRange` owns that
 * precedence and this file is one of its callers, not a second copy of it.
 *
 * The DTO therefore carries three windows and says which one is in force:
 *
 *  - `referenceLow` / `referenceHigh` — the EFFECTIVE bounds, the ones
 *    `rangeStatus` was computed from. A client that reads only these fields
 *    (including an iOS build that predates the source window) renders the
 *    right numbers and the right verdict with no change of its own.
 *  - `catalogReferenceLow` / `catalogReferenceHigh` — the catalog band, so a
 *    surface can paint both and show where they part.
 *  - `sourceReferenceLow` / `sourceReferenceHigh` / `sourceReferenceText` —
 *    what the report printed, the last verbatim.
 *
 * `referenceOrigin` names which window is in force and
 * `referenceDivergesFromCatalog` flags the case a reader must be told about.
 * Every value is resolved server-side; neither client recomputes a range,
 * guesses a unit, or re-derives the verdict.
 *
 * The two serialisers below spell every field out rather than spreading a
 * shared helper: `written-outcome-response-consumer-guard` walks these object
 * literals to enumerate the response leaves and pair each with a client
 * reader, and a spread of a function call hides them from it. A field added
 * here must be visible there.
