/**
 * Free-text reference-range parser for the range a lab report prints beside a
 * value.
 *
 * A report states its window in prose, not in columns: "3,5 - 5,0", "< 5",
 * "bis 5,0", "≥ 3,5", "150.000 - 400.000 /µl", or a word like "negativ" that
 * carries no window at all. The document-reading path and the manual entry
 * form both hand that string here.
 *
 * The contract is deliberately asymmetric:
 *
 *  - KEEPING the printed string is mandatory. `text` always carries what the
 *    report said, whitespace-normalised and length-capped, whether or not a
 *    bound could be derived from it. A window this parser cannot read is not
 *    a window that gets thrown away.
 *  - DERIVING bounds is best-effort and refuses on ambiguity. A string that
 *    does not match one of the notations below yields `low: null, high: null`
 *    beside the text. Absence reads as absence — the parser never picks a
 *    plausible bound out of a string it did not understand, because a fake
 *    window silently reclassifies a reading as normal or abnormal.
 *
 * Notations read (comma- or dot-decimal):
 *
 *   two-sided   3.5-5.0 · 3,5 – 5,0 · 3,5 bis 5,0 · 3.5 to 5.0 · 3,5 ... 5,0
 *               von 3,5 bis 5,0 · 3,5 à 5,0 · de 3,5 a 5,0 · da 3,5 a 5,0 ·
 *               od 3,5 do 5,0 · [3,5 - 5,0] · (3.5-5.0)
 *   upper only  < 5 · ≤ 5 · <= 5 · bis 5,0 · bis zu 5,0 · max. 5,0 ·
 *               kleiner 5 · unter 5 · up to 5.0 · less than 5 · jusqu'à 5,0 ·
 *               hasta 5,0 · fino a 5,0 · do 5,0 · poniżej 5,0
 *   lower only  > 3.5 · ≥ 3,5 · >= 3.5 · ab 3,5 · min. 3,5 · mindestens 3,5 ·
 *               größer 3,5 · über 3,5 · at least 3.5 · à partir de 3,5 ·
 *               desde 3,5 · da 3,5 · od 3,5 · powyżej 3,5
 *
 * WHY THE VOCABULARY IS TABULATED AND NOT DERIVED. Elsewhere in the app, a
 * matcher that has to recognise a word list in six languages builds its index
 * out of `messages/<locale>.json`, so a seventh locale works the day its
 * bundle lands. That does not apply here. "jusqu'à", "hasta", "fino a" and
 * "do" are prose a LAB printed on a sheet of paper; the app owns no string
 * they could be derived from, and the language of the report has nothing to do
 * with the language of the UI — a French self-hoster running the app in
 * English still receives French reports. So the table below is hand-written,
 * every locale's prose is tried against every input at once, and the honest
 * cost is written down: a report printed in a language absent from the table
 * yields text-only. `RANGE_PROSE` is keyed by the shipped `Locale` union
 * precisely so that adding a locale to `locales` fails to compile until
 * someone has answered "and how does that language print a range?".
 *
 * Units are read, never converted. A window may carry the unit the report
 * printed it in; when the caller states the reading's own unit and the two
 * disagree, the bounds are refused and only the text survives. Converting
 * mmol/L into mg/dL needs a per-analyte factor, so doing it here would be the
 * parser deciding what the report meant.

 * no entry at all, and a German or English range must read the same afterwards
 * as it did before.

 * Every list is applied to every input regardless of the reader's locale — see
 * the module comment for why. Multi-word entries match across any run of
