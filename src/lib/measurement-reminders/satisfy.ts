/**
 * v1.18.1 — the ONE shared satisfaction primitive for the Vorsorge /
 * measurement-reminder engine.
 *
 * Every path that marks a reminder's cadence fulfilled routes through
 * `satisfyReminder`: the manual "Erledigt" route, the cron auto-resolve,
 * and the eventful ingest-driven satisfaction worker. No duplicated
 * reschedule logic — one place stamps `lastSatisfiedAt` and recomputes the
 * server-authoritative `nextDueAt`.
 *
 * Invariants the primitive owns:
 *
 *   1. **Forward-only.** `lastSatisfiedAt` only ever moves forward. A
 *      cron poll and an ingest enqueue can both fire for the same reading;
 *      the second is a no-op (returns `false`) rather than re-stamping an
 *      older instant. This is what makes the cron a safe idempotent
 *      safety-net behind the eventful hook.
 *   2. **Re-anchored reschedule.** `nextDueAt` is recomputed via the
 *      canonical recurrence engine (`computeReminderNextDueAt`) from
 *      `max(satisfiedAt, lastSkippedAt)` — the satisfy instant, unless the
 *      user has since skipped, in which case a BACKDATED real result is
 *      recorded as `lastSatisfiedAt` but never drags the due date back
 *      behind the skip decision (v1.37.20, #223).
 *   3. **Ledger append.** A successful satisfy appends one
 *      `MeasurementReminderEvent` row (iOS #68) with `onTime` derived at
 *      write time against the pre-event `nextDueAt` — the only moment that
 *      value still exists.
 *   4. **Snooze clearing.** A satisfy recomputes `nextDueAt`, so it nulls
 *      `snoozedUntil` — the snooze cursor never outlives the cycle it
 *      pushed back.
 *
 * Pure-ish: it reads the row fields it is handed and issues one conditional
 * update plus one ledger insert. The caller supplies the reminder row, the
 * user's timezone, and which engine path it is (`source`).
