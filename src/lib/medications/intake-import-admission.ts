/**
 * The one admission path for an intake-import job.
 *
 * Two routes queue this work — the per-medication import under
 * `/api/medications/[id]/…` and the account-wide dose-history import — and both
 * have to do the same five things in the same order: take a row lock so two
 * submissions cannot race past each other, fail out any job the worker
 * abandoned, refuse if one is genuinely still running, write the job row, and
 * hand it to pg-boss with a fallback that marks the row failed when the queue
 * is not there. Written twice, those five steps drift: one route grows a
 * staleness clause the other does not, and the difference only shows up as an
 * import that hangs forever on one surface and not the other.
 *
 * `readMedicationIntakeImportJob` took the read half of this pair out of the
 * routes for the same reason. This is the write half.
 *
 * The only real difference between the two callers is scope, and it is one
 * argument: `medicationId` narrows the lock, the active-job check and the job
 * row to a single medication, `null` means the whole account. Everything the
 * caller still owns — the 409 wording, the success envelope, the kickoff audit
 * line — stays at the call site, because those are the parts the two surfaces
 * legitimately say differently.
