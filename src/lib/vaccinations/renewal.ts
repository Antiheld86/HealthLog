/**
 * Whether a vaccination is still current, surfaced where the person looks.
 *
 * The data already exists and is the person's own: when a dose is logged, the
 * app offers to plan the booster from the catalogue's interval, and what the
 * person confirms becomes an ordinary reminder keyed on the antigen
 * (`MeasurementReminder.vaccinationAntigen`, minted in `booster-mint.ts`).
 * Logging the next dose re-anchors it. Its `nextDueAt` is the renewal date.
 * Until now it lived only on `/checkups`, and the vaccination page itself said
 * nothing about it.
 *
 * This module reads that date and resolves it to a state, once, on the
 * server, so the web page and the native client agree. It does NOT compute a
 * due date from age, history or the catalogue: an antigen with no confirmed
 * booster has no renewal here. That line is the one `series.ts` draws — due
 * computation from a person's history is a different kind of product — and it
 * is why the source is the confirmed reminder and nothing else.
 *
 * Pure: no DB read. The route owns the read and the grant check.
