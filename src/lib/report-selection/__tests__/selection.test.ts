/**
 * The selection type's contract: what each of the three minting functions does

 *
 * Mutation checks:
 *   - make `selectionFromStoredBlob` fall back to `STANDARD_TEMPLATE_LEAVES`
 *     instead of the empty selection → "an unreadable blob resolves to
 *     nothing" goes red.
 *   - make `selectionFromRequest` drop unknown ids instead of rejecting →
 *     "a request naming an id this build does not know is refused" goes red.
 *   - drop the `.filter(isReportLeafId)` in `selectionFromStoredBlob` → "a
 *     stored blob naming a retired leaf drops it" goes red.
