 * One definition of "this text carries a credential HealthLog or a common

 *
 *   `hlk_` access tokens, `hlr_` refresh tokens, `hls_` clinician share-link
 *   tokens, `hlv_` registration invite tokens, `hle_` elevation tokens;
 *   `sk-…` / `sk-ant-…` OpenAI and Anthropic keys, in the full token form
 *   only: a bare `sk-` substring ("task-id", "risk-management") is not a key,
 *   and matching it would refuse benign text.
 *
 * It is a shape test, not a secret detector. A credential without one of
 * these prefixes (a relay's own app token, a password) passes, so a caller
 * that knows the secrets in play must also refuse text containing them.
