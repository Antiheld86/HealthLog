/**
 * v1.37.0 — the browser's half of the record-session fence.
 *
 * Every same-origin API request says which record it believes it is addressing,
 * and every response that resolved a record scope says which one it was
 * actually served under. This module holds both halves: the adopted context,
 * the request headers built from it, and the response check.
 *
 * ─── Where the context comes from ─────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Exactly two responses may be ADOPTED from: `GET /api/auth/me` and
 * `POST /api/account/switch`. Both are actor surfaces that resolve canonical
 * session state, and both carry the context in the response BODY. Every other
 * response's echoed context is used to VALIDATE and never to adopt — which is
 * also why the 409 refusal carries only an error code and no epoch: a refusal
 * arriving on a request whose context is in doubt is the worst possible third
 * source of truth.
 *
 * ─── Why it is in memory only ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Not mirrored to storage. `/api/auth/me` runs on every boot and is the single
 * bootstrap, so a storage mirror would be a second answer that can go stale
 * across a deploy — and the `bootstrap` sentinel already makes the
 * pre-adoption window safe by producing a 409 rather than a served request.
 *
 * ─── The validation rule is MISMATCH-ONLY ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A response is discarded only when it carries an echo that CONTRADICTS the
 * adopted context. A response carrying NO echo is returned untouched, because
 * absence means "this response resolved no record scope" — which is exactly
 * true for public routes, actor surfaces, admin, `/me` itself, and static
 * responses.
 *
 * The concrete thing a discard-on-absence rule breaks:
 * `src/components/version-poller.tsx` polls the PUBLIC `/api/version` through
 * `apiGet` on a timer. That response resolves no record and echoes nothing, so
 * a discard-on-absence client would enter the safe hold and fire a network-only
 * `/me` on every poll cycle, forever. Do not "tighten" this rule.
 *
 * The case mismatch-only appears to give up — a service-worker disk-cache hit
 * that predates the fence and therefore carries no echo — is closed elsewhere:
 * `public/sw.js` names its caches by the app release and its `activate` handler
 * deletes every `healthlog-(static|pages|data)-*` cache not in the current set,
 * so the deploy that ships the fence evicts every pre-fence cached response
 * before one can be served. A POST-fence cached record response does carry the
 * echo it was cached with, so replaying it after a switch is a mismatch and is
 * discarded.
