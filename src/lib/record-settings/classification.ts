 * to nobody else; neither can express "the same set the route admits", which
 * for the anamnesis surface is a Guardian on a managed profile AND an adult
 * delegate holding MANAGE.
 *
 * That gap had a consequence rather than being a taxonomy nicety. `POST
 * /api/allergies` and `POST /api/family-history` both resolve
 * `requireRecordAuth("manage", "profile")` — the write is admitted, audited
 * and owner-scoped — while the only form in the product that posts to either
 * lives under Settings → Anamnese, which was classified unavailable. An
 * admitted write with no reachable caller is the one-ended change this
 * repository keeps rediscovering: the permission ships, the surface is "the
 * follow-up", and every other check proves the other end.
 *
 * `guardianWritable` is true because a Guardian writes here too; the kind is
 * what says the destination is not guardian-ONLY.

 * schema rejects a manage entry with sections), so this changes nothing for a
 * managed profile or an adult MANAGE share as they exist. It keeps the list
 * true if a scoped MANAGE grant ever reaches the client, rather than offering a
 * page whose writes answer 403.
 *
 * Every destination on either list needs MANAGE, so the level is checked once
 * for both record kinds. A guardian grant is always MANAGE today, which is
 * exactly why the check was easy to leave out, and a managed entry that ever
 * arrived below it would have listed destinations the section gate refuses.
