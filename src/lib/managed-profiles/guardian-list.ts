/**
 * v1.37.0 — who looks after one managed profile.
 *
 * The read the removal route always needed. `DELETE
 * /api/managed-profiles/{id}/guardians/{grantId}` shipped with integration
 * coverage and no caller, because nothing in the product could hand a browser a
 * `grantId` for it: `GET /api/account/grants` returns the CALLER's grants, and
 * a Guardian grant has the PROFILE as grantor, so a Guardian's given-list never
 * contains one.
 *
 * ## What it discloses, and what it deliberately does not
 *
 * `GRANT_PARTY_SELECT` — `{ id, username, displayName }` — and nothing else per
 * Guardian. That is exactly what one party to a grant already sees of another
 * on the sharing panel today, so this route widens nobody's reach; it makes
 * reachable, on the record's own page, a fact the same person can already read
 * one page over. No e-mail, no channel data, no `lastUsedAt`.
 *
 * `access` and `scope` are omitted because they are constants here: a Guardian
 * grant is always `MANAGE` with `scope: null` (`inviteManagedProfileGuardian`),
 * and publishing a constant invites a client to branch on it.
 *
 * ## Why `state` is derived and not read
 *
 * Through `grantState()`, the same function the request resolver's own
 * predicate is built on. A second derivation from `acceptedAt` would drift in
 * the dangerous direction — a roster saying "accepted" about a grant the
 * resolver has stopped honouring, or the reverse — and this roster is what the
 * card counts to decide whether a remove control may exist at all.
 *
 * EXPIRED and REVOKED rows are filtered out rather than published. The question
 * this answers is "who looks after this record NOW"; an ended Guardian grant is
 * history that belongs to the grant panel, not to a floor calculation.

/**
 * The roster, or `null` when the caller may not have it.
 *
 * One `null` for three different situations — no such account, an account that
 * is not a managed profile, and a profile the caller is not an active Guardian
 * of — so the route answers the same 404 to all three. An adult record whose
 * owner happened to grant somebody MANAGE is not a managed profile and must be
 * indistinguishable from one that does not exist, exactly as it is in
 * `inviteManagedProfileGuardian`.
 *
 * No lock and no transaction. `withManagedProfileLock` exists to serialize
 * lifecycle TRANSITIONS so a reducer decides from a committed count rather than
 * a stale one; taking it for a panel refresh would put an advisory lock on a
 * read that guards no invariant. The roster is a snapshot and is allowed to be
 * one — which is why the last-Guardian refusal stays enforced at the route that
 * changes something, and the card's pre-emptive floor is a courtesy on top of
 * it rather than a replacement for it.
