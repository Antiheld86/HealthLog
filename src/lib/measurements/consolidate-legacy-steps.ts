/**
 * v1.5.6 — consolidate pre-v1.5.0 legacy step rows into one daily-total
 * row per user per calendar day.
 *
 * Pre-v1.5.0, HealthKit step samples landed at sampling granularity —
 * hundreds-to-thousands of `ACTIVITY_STEPS` rows per day. Post-v1.5.0,
 * iOS emits one overwrite-able daily-total row carrying the
 * `stats:HKQuantityTypeIdentifierStepCount:YYYY-MM-DD` externalId
 * (see `src/app/api/measurements/batch/route.ts` stats-overwrite logic).
 * This pass collapses the legacy granular rows into the same canonical
 * daily shape so historical step data reads consistently.
 *
 * Per user × calendar day (anchored to `User.timezone`):
 *   1. SELECT live (`deletedAt IS NULL`) `ACTIVITY_STEPS` rows that are
 *      genuine legacy raw per-sample rows — `source` in the writable set
 *      (`APPLE_HEALTH` / `MANUAL` / `IMPORT`) AND `externalId` NOT already
 *      in ANY provider's daily-total `stats:` shape. A row keyed `stats:%`
 *      is already an aggregated daily total (Apple `stats:HK…`, Google /
 *      Fitbit `stats:steps:…`) and must never be re-consolidated; a
 *      provider-owned row (`GOOGLE_HEALTH` / `FITBIT` / `WITHINGS` / …) is a
 *      server-side daily aggregate that this pass must never touch. See the
 *      scope note on `buildScanWhere` below.
 *   2. Group into per-day buckets in the user's timezone.
 *   3. SUM the legacy values for the day.
 *   4. UPSERT the canonical daily-total row keyed by
 *      `stats:HKQuantityTypeIdentifierStepCount:<dateKey>`. If a daily
 *      total already exists for the day (post-v1.5.0 iOS already wrote
 *      one), the existing total is the source of truth — it is NOT
 *      overwritten and the legacy sum is NOT folded in (avoids double-
 *      counting: the post-v1.5.0 row already represents the true daily
 *      total HealthKit computed). The legacy granular rows are still
 *      soft-deleted so they stop polluting the per-sample read path.
 *   5. SOFT-DELETE (set `deletedAt`) the legacy granular rows — they
 *      stay in the table as an audit/backup trail. Sampling-granularity
 *      loss is explicitly accepted.
 *
 * Idempotent: the discovery query (`enqueueBootTimeStepConsolidation`)
 * matches only users still holding live legacy step rows, so a second
 * run converges to zero work. Within a run, soft-deleted legacy rows
 * are excluded from the scan, so a re-run after a partial pass never
 * re-aggregates an already-consolidated day.
 *
 * Runs on pg-boss (`STEP_CONSOLIDATION_QUEUE`), not a CLI — the
 * production standalone image strips `tsx`. Modelled on the
 * `rollup-full-backfill` boot-time converging-backfill pattern.
