/**
 * Client-side message-bundle loading.
 *
 * NO catalog ships statically in the client chunk — not even English.
 * The static EN import that used to live here was the single largest
 * every-route client cost (334 KB raw / ~106 KB gz on every page load,
 * for every user, in every language). The t() chain (active locale →
 * EN → raw key) now resolves its bundles through three paths:
 *
 *   1. SSR pass: this module seeds its cache with the full server-side
 *      catalog map (`shared-resolve`) inside a `typeof window ===
 *      "undefined"` branch. Turbopack compiles the branch away for the
 *      browser bundle (verified — zero catalog bytes reach any client
 *      chunk), while the server render of every client component
 *      resolves the active locale synchronously — SSR text stays
 *      correct with nothing serialized into the flight payload (the
 *      previous RSC-prop handoff inlined the whole active catalog into
 *      EVERY document: 392 KB of a 505 KB dashboard HTML).
 *   2. First client paint: the root layout registers a versioned,
 *      immutable-cacheable `<script src="/i18n/<locale>?v=…">` through
 *      `next/script` at `beforeInteractive`, so Next's own bootstrap
 *      awaits it before requiring any app module. It assigns
 *      `self.__HL_I18N`, which `adoptBootBundle()` below folds into the
 *      cache on first read — the first client render holds the same
 *      bundle the server rendered with (no raw-key flash, no hydration
 *      mismatch), and repeat visits serve the catalog from HTTP/SW cache
 *      instead of re-downloading it inside each document.
 *   3. Locale switch / EN fallback: `loadMessages()` dynamic-imports
 *      the target bundle on demand; each locale becomes its own async
 *      chunk that only the users who need it ever download.
 *
 * The module-level cache makes repeat switches instant and lets tests
 * seed bundles directly (`primeMessages`).
