/**
 * Why the obvious suspect is not the cause.
 *
 * The tempting explanation for a column stuck on the wrong language is a
 * race: first paint renders the default, the mount effect persists THAT,
 * the client then flips to the real locale and persists again, and two
 * unordered `keepalive` PUTs land in the wrong order. It would explain the
 * symptom exactly, and it would mean the write needs ordering.
 *
 * It is not what happens. The provider takes the locale the SERVER already
 * resolved — cookie, then column, then Accept-Language — and nothing on the
 * mount path changes it afterwards, so the effect fires once, with the right
 * value, and there is no second write to race with. The write is lost a
 * simpler way: it is fire-and-forget, so a 401 on the paint before sign-in,
 * an offline blip or a tab closed mid-flight drops it, and the next mount
 * repeats the same unreliable attempt rather than noticing.
 *
 * These pin the two properties that rule the race out, so that a future
 * change which does introduce a mount-time flip has to face this file.
