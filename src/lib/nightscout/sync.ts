/**
 * Nightscout CGM sync (v1.17.0).
 *
 * Pulls the most recent SGV entries from the user's self-hosted Nightscout
 * instance and writes each as a `BLOOD_GLUCOSE` mg/dL Measurement tagged
 * `source = NIGHTSCOUT`. This is the CGM density that makes the clinical
 * glucose panel (TIR / GMI) real — a continuous stream rather than the manual
 * spot readings.
 *
 * Idempotency: each row's `externalId` is derived from Nightscout's `_id` (or
 * the reading's epoch ms), and the write is FIRST-WRITE-WINS — a CGM sample is
 * an immutable canonical reading, so the `(userId, type, source, externalId)`
 * unique collapses a re-sync onto the existing row and the `update` branch is a
 * no-op (no value overwrite). This mirrors the Apple Health immutable-sample
 * contract, not the WHOOP re-score overwrite.
 *
 * Status bookkeeping rides the shared integration ledger (`nightscout` key): a
 * clean pass stamps `recordSyncSuccess`; an unreachable instance / wrong token
 * records a classified `recordSyncFailure` and rethrows so the cohort runner
 * can warn-and-continue.
