/**
 * `windowDays` is a route parameter now, and a route parameter that a
 * dispatch arm quietly drops is worse than no parameter at all — the caller
 * asks for sixty days, gets fourteen, and has nothing in the payload to tell
 * them apart. This suite freezes the two halves of that contract:
 *
 *   1. Every dispatch arm that CAN honour a caller-supplied window does, and
 *      says so in `provenance.windowDays`. An arm added later that forgets to
 *      thread `args.windowDays` fails here rather than shipping silently.
 *   2. The arms that structurally cannot honour it are named, and their
 *      `provenance.windowDays` still reports the window they actually used —
 *      so a client comparing what it asked for against what came back can
 *      see the difference instead of guessing.
 *
 * The check is behavioural, not a grep over the dispatcher's source: it calls
 * each metric with an unmistakable window and reads the answer back.
