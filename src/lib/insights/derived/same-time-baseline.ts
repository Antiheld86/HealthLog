/**
 * v1.34.0 — the same-time baseline for a cumulative metric.
 *
 * `signals-of-day` excludes steps and says why in its own comment: intraday
 * step rows arrive as many partial-day fragments, so the newest raw row is not
 * a reading. Every other derived metric in this directory compares a latest
 * value to a band, and for a quantity that accumulates through the day that
 * comparison has no meaning — four thousand steps is a good day at 09:00 and a
 * poor one at 22:00.
 *
 * So this engine compares along the other axis. It takes today's running total
 * at the last COMPLETED local hour and puts it against the same person's own
 * typical total at that same hour, drawn from a trailing four weeks of their
 * stored intraday profiles (`intraday-cumulative-profile.ts`). Same estimator
 * as the vitals baseline — median for the centre, median ± k·MAD·1.4826 for
 * the band — so a reader who understands one understands the other.
 *
 * Everything the surface renders is decided HERE: the two curves, the delta,
 * the percentage, the band edges and the verdict of where today sits. The copy
 * is a deterministic template over these numbers. Nothing downstream computes a
 * comparison, and the Coach may explain one that already exists but may never
 * produce one.
 *
 * What it deliberately does not produce: a projected day total. Extrapolating
 * a partial day is a guess, and a feature that exists to replace guesses with
 * the person's own history has no business shipping one.
