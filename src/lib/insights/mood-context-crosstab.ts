/**
 * Day context against the day's mood, with the count on every statement.
 *
 * The question this answers is "on the days you recorded a conflict, how did
 * the mood value sit against the days you did not" — and the answer is a
 * comparison, never a cause. Nothing in this file, and nothing rendered from
 * it, may say that a context value made a day worse. It did not, and the data
 * cannot know whether it did.
 *
 * The statistics are borrowed rather than rebuilt. The Welch t-test, the
 * Benjamini-Hochberg step-up, the per-side day floors and the FDR threshold
 * all come from the machinery the tag crosstab already runs. That matters more
 * here than it sounds: a context sweep tests a few dozen values at once, and a
 * raw p < 0.05 over that many comparisons surfaces one-in-twenty noise as a
 * finding. The BH correction is the difference between a board that means
 * something and a board that always has something on it.
 *
 * The floors are constants with names because Phase 3's model will import
 * them rather than declare a second set that drifts from these.
