/**
 * What a request says it is acting as.
 *
 * Two things in the app have to answer that question, and they have to answer
 * it the same way:
 *
 *   * `requireRecordAuth` (`src/lib/api-handler.ts`), which turns the claim
 *     into a data scope after checking a live grant.
 *   * `withIdempotency` (`src/lib/idempotency.ts`), which files the replay cell
 *     under the record the request claims — before any handler runs, so it
 *     cannot wait for the grant check the handler performs.
 *
 * The claim is a SELECTOR and never an authorisation. Nothing in this file
 * looks at a grant, and no caller may treat a carrier as permission: the
 * account named here is an id to be checked. What it decides is only which
 * account is being named, and by which transport — the question `grants.ts`
 * warns must have exactly one answer, because a second implementation of it
 * drifts and the copy that drifts is the one nobody reads.
 *
 * The transport rules, unchanged from where they were first written:
 *
 *   * The cookie transport carries the claim on the session ROW. A browser
 *     cannot address that row, so the value is server state written only by
 *     the switch endpoint after it validated a grant.
 *   * The Bearer transport carries it in a per-request HEADER. A long-lived
 *     token must not accumulate switch state.
 *   * The header on a cookie request is `misplaced`, not ignored — a client
 *     that believes it is selecting an account and is not produces a support
 *     case about data that looks wrong.

/**
 * The session a server-rendered PAGE may prefetch from, or null.
 *
 * A server-prefetching page dehydrates a health record into the HTML document
 * and seeds it into the client's TanStack cache under the key the client cell
 * will read. That copy is only ever right when the account the page read is
 * the account the client's ROUTE would answer with, and under a switch it
 * never is. `getSession()` answers who is CALLING, deliberately and
 * permanently (`session.ts` — it is the same property that keeps `requireAdmin`
 * out of a delegate's reach), so a page that prefetches off it seeds the
 * DELEGATE's record onto a page whose banner names the owner. What happens
 * next depends only on which mode the route declared, and both endings are
 * wrong:
 *
 *   - a non-delegable route refuses the client's refetch, so the delegate's
 *     own numbers stay on the owner's dashboard until the tab is closed;
 *   - a delegable route answers with the owner's rows, so the page shows two
 *     people at once for as long as the refetch takes.
 *
 * Resolving the acting account here instead — reading the record the way a
 * route does — is the tempting other answer and is worse. The grant check
 * lives in exactly one function (`requireRecordAuth`), the pages cannot reach
 * it without an HTTP context, and re-deriving it here would be a second
 * program deciding "whose record is this" — the thing `grants.ts` warns must
 * have one answer. Worse, half of what these pages prefetch rides routes that
 * declared themselves NOT delegable; prefetching the owner's copy would hand a
 * delegate data the API is on record refusing them.
 *
 * So the prefetch is an accelerator that steps aside. Under a switch this
 * returns null, the page renders its bare client shell, and every cell fetches
 * through the routes — which is where the grant check is, and the only place
 * it should ever have been. The cost is one skeleton frame on a delegated
 * visit; nothing is lost that a fetch does not restore.
 *
 * Fail-closed on the ambiguous case too: a selector HEADER on this transport
 * is `misplaced-header`, which names no account and is not a switch, but it is
 * a client asserting it meant to be somewhere else. A page has nothing to gain
 * by prefetching through that, so it does not.

 * It resolves the session itself for exactly one reason: the transport decides
 * which carrier counts, and "there is a valid session" is what the transport
 * is. Guessing it from the presence of a cookie or an `Authorization` header
 * would be a second, weaker answer to a question this file exists to answer
 * once — and the case it gets wrong (a stale session cookie beside a live
 * Bearer token) is precisely a delegated write landing in the wrong cell.
 *
 * The cost is one indexed session lookup on a request that is already about to
 * write. It is not shared with the caller's own auth resolution because the
 * resolver a route passes to `withIdempotency` is pluggable, and threading a
 * session through that seam would make every custom resolver responsible for a
 * question none of them asks.
 *
 * Returns the CLAIMED account, unverified and unchecked. `undefined` means
 * the carrier was unsafe to resolve: today, that is a selector header on a
 * cookie request. The idempotency wrapper must then skip replay and let the
 * handler issue its normal refusal instead of treating ambiguity as an
 * unswitched own-record request. The grant check happens later, inside the
 * handler, on every request.
