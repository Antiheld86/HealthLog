/**
 * MfaChallenge — the short-lived, single-use login step-up ticket.
 *
 * When a password (or other primary credential) is accepted for an account
 * that has a second factor enabled, **no session or token is issued**.
 * Instead a challenge row is minted: the partial "password OK, awaiting
 * factor 2" state lives entirely in this row, never in a half-built
 * `Session`. The caller receives an opaque ticket; only its hash
 * (`hashToken`) is stored, so a leaked database row cannot reconstruct a
 * usable ticket.
 *
 * Guarantees enforced here:
 * - **TTL** (~5 min) — `expiresAt`; an expired ticket is never loadable.
 * - **Attempt cap** — every verification first RESERVES an attempt with one
 *   guarded UPDATE (`attempts < cap` in the WHERE), so the cap bounds the
 *   number of guesses even when they arrive concurrently. It used to be a
 *   read, a verification, then an increment: parallel requests all read the
 *   same count below the cap and every one of them got to guess. A failed
 *   verification then burns the ticket (`consumedAt` set) once the cap is
 *   hit, forcing a fresh password login (NIST throttle, not an account lock).
 * - **Claim-once** — consuming a ticket is an atomic guarded update
 *   (`consumedAt: null` in the WHERE), so two concurrent verifications can
 *   never both succeed and mint two sessions. The factor is verified first;
 *   the session is issued only after the claim wins.
