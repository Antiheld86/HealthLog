/**
 * Re-proving a credential the account already holds.
 *
 * Several surfaces accept a fresh proof in the request body before they act:
 * the Bearer step-up mint, the primary-passkey enrollment, TOTP enrollment and
 * security-key enrollment. They used to verify it each in their own way, and
 * the copies drifted — one checked who owned a WebAuthn challenge but not its
 * type, one had no rate limit and wrote no audit row for a wrong password, so
 * a stolen session could guess the password or a TOTP code there without
 * limit and without trace. This module is the one verifier and the one
 * throttle, so every surface refuses, counts and records a failed proof the
 * same way.
 *
 * The throttle is ONE bucket per account shared by every surface: five proofs
 * in fifteen minutes, the ceiling the step-up mint has used since it shipped
 * (same key, so its counter carries straight over). A shared bucket means a
 * guesser cannot multiply the budget by rotating between routes.

 *

 *
 * Without one (password, passkey or single sign-on only), any of:
 *   - the session completed a passkey sign-in or re-proof within the last five
 *     minutes (`Session.mfaVerifiedAt`);
 *   - the session re-proved a credential at `POST /api/auth/reproof` within

 *     `{ method: "totp", code }` or a passkey / security-key assertion, the

 *
 * With one, only a proof of possession of a factor: `Session.mfaVerifiedAt`
 * within five minutes, or a TOTP code, security-key or passkey assertion in
 * the body. A password is not enough and neither is a young session: signing
 * in on a remembered browser skips the second factor and still creates a
 * fresh session, so `createdAt` would let the password alone add a new key,
 * which then satisfies every gate the second factor was protecting.
