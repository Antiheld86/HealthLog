/**
 * The per-account half of the password sign-in throttle.
 *
 * The per-IP bucket on the login route is only as good as the address it is
 * keyed on, so a second limit follows the account wherever the guesses come
 * from. It used to be a hard ceiling: ten failures in fifteen minutes and the
 * account refused every password, charged before the password was checked.
 * That made the owner's own sign-in a thing anybody could switch off. Ten
 * wrong guesses from two addresses locked a password-only account, the phone
 * app's password sign-in with it, and repeating them every fifteen minutes
 * kept it locked for as long as the person bothered.
 *
 * Two changes answer that.
 *
 * A place the account has signed in from before is not counted and not
 * blocked. "Before" means a remembered browser (the trusted-device cookie,
 * checked without being spent), a phone that presents the device id a login
 * of this account was issued to, or an address a session or device login of
 * this account was created from in the last thirty days. The guesser is by
 * definition somewhere the account has not signed in from; the owner mostly
 * is not. The per-IP limit still applies to every caller.
 *
 * Everywhere else gets a growing wait instead of a wall. Five failures a day
 * cost nothing; after that each failure makes the next attempt wait twice as
 * long as the last, starting at thirty seconds and never more than fifteen
 * minutes. A guesser gets a handful of tries an hour, which is as hopeless as
 * the old ceiling, and the owner on a new network waits minutes at worst,
 * never indefinitely.
 *
 * An identifier that names no account runs the same arithmetic on its hash,
 * so a wait says nothing about whether the account exists.
