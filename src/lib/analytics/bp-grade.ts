/**
 * v1.15.12 A1 — graded blood-pressure pillar score.
 *
 * The Personal Health Score's BP pillar previously equalled
 * `bpInTargetRate`: the share of paired readings where BOTH systolic and
 * diastolic sat at-or-below the age-band ceiling, scored binary per
 * reading over the all-time window. That metric is honest as a "% of
 * readings in range" stat, but it is the wrong thing to use AS the
 * pillar score: a user who averages 134/87 (borderline stage-1, every
 * reading slightly over the diastolic ceiling) collapses to ~10-16/100
 * because nearly every reading fails the binary check — even though
 * clinically they are "a bit high", not catastrophic. Improvement also
 * never shows, because the rate is all-time and a binary cliff.
 *
 * This module replaces the binary rate AS THE SCORE with a smooth
 * clinical-proximity grade. A representative BP (recency-weighted toward
 * the last weeks) is mapped to a 0-100 score per axis, and the pillar
 * takes the WORSE of the two sub-scores — so an elevated diastolic
 * counts against the score (it should) without binary-zeroing it.
 *
 * The curve is anchored on the SAME age-band ceiling the rest of the app
 * uses (`BpTargets.sysHigh` / `diaHigh` from `bp-targets.ts`). No new
 * thresholds are invented; the score bands are derived as offsets from
 * the configured ceiling:
 *
 *   offset from ceiling   →  axis score
 *   ≤ −12 (well below)        100  (optimal — comfortably in band)
 *      0  (at the ceiling)     85  (at goal — "well controlled")
 *     +5                       65
 *    +10                       52
 *    +20                       40
 *    +40                       18
 *    ≥ +60                      5  (far above — uncontrolled)
 *
 * Piecewise-linear between anchors — no hard cliffs, so a one-mmHg
 * change moves the score by a small, continuous amount. The diastolic
 * and systolic axes share the same offset→score table, so each axis is
 * judged against its own ceiling.
 *
 * Hypotension is penalised on a SEPARATE under-floor curve that is
 * CONTINUOUS with the optimal plateau at the boundary: at exactly the
 * clinical floor (`sys = 90`, `dia = 50`, mirroring `isBpReadingInTarget`)
 * the score is 100, and it descends smoothly as the value drops further
 * below the floor. The earlier implementation fed `floor − value` through
 * the over-target table, which made 1 mmHg under the floor jump to ~81 —
 * a 19-point cliff against the 100 the plateau holds AT the floor. The
 * dedicated anchors below (floor→100, floor−10→70, floor−20→45,
 * floor−30→20) mirror the over-target steepness without the cliff, so the
 * curve is continuous on BOTH sides of every boundary.
 *
 * Pure & deterministic — fully unit-tested in `__tests__/bp-grade.test.ts`.
