/**
 * The per-user recipe boundary, at the two places it exists.
 *
 * The end-to-end proof that a settings change is never narrated as a
 * health event lives in `config-change-is-not-a-health-event.test.ts`,
 * over the real snapshot and digest. This file covers what that one
 * cannot reach without a fixture per case: the boundary arithmetic's
 * edges and the notice key's two dimensions.
 *
 * Each guard here has a counter-case beside it. A boundary that
 * suppressed everything would pass every "no false drop" assertion ever
 * written and silence every honest week as well, which is the same
 * defect wearing the opposite sign.
