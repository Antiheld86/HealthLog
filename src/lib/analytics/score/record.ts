/**
 * Writing the health score down.
 *
 * The score is computed live, every time, from the rows standing behind it at
 * that moment. That is the right thing for today and it is why nothing older
 * than today survives: correct a reading from last month, finish a sync that
 * had stalled, or simply add the fourteenth night of sleep that made a pillar
 * eligible, and the score the person saw back then can no longer be
 * reproduced. There is nothing dishonest about that, but it does mean the
 * "history" a surface can offer today is two numbers computed seconds apart.
 *
 * So each local day's score is written down once, the first time it is
 * computed, and then left alone. Three properties follow, and all three are
 * deliberate:
 *
 *   * **Append-only.** A second computation of the same local day finds the
 *     row and does nothing. Not an upsert with a cleverer conflict target,
 *     not a "refresh if newer" — the number the person saw stays the number
 *     they saw. Restating it would make the stored series agree with whatever
 *     the data happens to look like now, which is precisely the property that
 *     makes it worth nothing.
 *   * **Never authoritative.** No surface reads this instead of computing.
 *     The record answers questions about past days; today's number always
 *     comes from today's rows.
 *   * **Never fatal.** The write hangs off a read path. A score that renders
 *     must not fail because a bookkeeping insert did, so the failure is
 *     annotated onto the wide event and swallowed. The integration round trip
 *     is what proves the write actually happens; a unit test that only
 *     watches this function return would be watching it succeed at nothing.
 *
 * Server-only — reaches for the Prisma client.
