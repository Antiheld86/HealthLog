/**
 * OpenAPI 3.1 base registry (v1.4.23 / Wave 4 F5a).
 *
 * Per the W1 stream-3 decision: `zod-openapi` (samchungy) reads Zod v4's
 * native `.meta()` metadata, so we annotate schemas in their original
 * validation files and register the route table here. The committed
 * spec at `docs/api/openapi.yaml` is regenerated via
 * `pnpm openapi:generate`; the CI gate in `.github/workflows/security.yml`
 * runs `pnpm openapi:check` to detect drift.
 *
 * The v1.4.23 baseline covers the 6-8 routes the v1.5 iOS app touches
 * (auth/login, auth/passkey/login-verify, auth/refresh, measurements
 * GET + POST + batch, devices POST, insights/comprehensive). Future
 * waves expand coverage organically as routes are touched. Once the
 * registry catches the rest of the hand-maintained spec, the CI gate
 * flips from `continue-on-error: true` to hard-fail.
 *
 * The registry is intentionally split:
 *   - `openApiBase` carries the static document scaffolding (info,
 *     servers, tags).
 *   - `buildOpenApiDocument` assembles the full spec by importing the
 *     registered route table from `./routes`. Routes live in their own
 *     file so additions don't touch the base.

  /**
   * How a caller authenticates, for every operation that does not say
   * otherwise.
   *
   * The two schemes were defined under `components.securitySchemes` from the
   * start and referenced by nothing — no document-level `security`, none on any
   * operation. That is not a small omission: a client generated from the
   * contract wires neither the `Authorization` header nor the session cookie,
   * and reads the whole surface as an open API. The schemes being present is
   * exactly what hid it, because the obvious check passes.
   *
   * Two entries rather than one object with two keys. In OpenAPI an array is
   * OR and the keys inside one object are AND, so `[{bearerAuth: []},
   * {cookieAuth: []}]` says "a token or a session", which is what the server
   * accepts. One object with both keys would demand both at once.
   *
   * The order is deliberate: a generator that picks the first scheme it
   * understands should reach for the Bearer token, because the native client is
   * the reason this contract is published. The browser has its cookie already.
   *
   * Operations that genuinely take no credential override this with
   * `security: []`; `openapi-security-declaration-guard.test.ts` holds the list
   * of those and fails on an opt-out that is not on it. Note that the proxy's
   * `PUBLIC_PATHS` is a different question and not the list — it says what the
   * edge lets through, not what the handler behind it accepts, and
   * `/api/ingest/medication` is on it while requiring a Bearer token.
