/**
 * OpenAPI route table for the document picker (`/api/documents/sources/*`,
 * #1038): a person's connection to Paperless-ngx or Papra, searching it, and
 * importing picked documents into the vault.
 *
 * Every operation is cookie-only (declared per operation as `cookieAuth`): a
 * Bearer, even a `["*"]` one, is refused 403 `documents.sources.browserOnly`,
 * and so is a request acting on another person's record. The native client does
 * not use these routes. Request bodies reuse the runtime Zod schemas.
