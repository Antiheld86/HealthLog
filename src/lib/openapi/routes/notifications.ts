/**
 * OpenAPI route table — notification channels: per-event preferences and
 * per-channel delivery health.
 *
 * Part of the OpenAPI route table; aggregated in `./index.ts`. The request
 * bodies come from `src/lib/validations/notifications.ts` so the wire contract
 * stays single-source; the response DTOs mirror the handlers under
 * `src/app/api/notifications/*`.
 *
 * The channel and event vocabularies are read from
 * `src/lib/notifications/types.ts` rather than restated, so a new channel type
 * or event category cannot be added to the dispatcher and quietly go missing
 * from the published contract.
