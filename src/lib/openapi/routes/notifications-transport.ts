/**
 * OpenAPI route table — notification transport: the VAPID key a client needs
 * to subscribe, the Web Push subscription lifecycle, and the per-channel
 * self-tests.
 *
 * Part of the OpenAPI route table; aggregated in `./index.ts`. Kept separate
 * from `./notifications.ts` — which owns per-event preferences and per-channel
 * delivery health — because the two answer different questions: that module
 * describes what gets sent and whether it arrived, this one the plumbing a
 * client sets up and then verifies.
 *
 * Schemas come from `src/lib/validations/notifications.ts` where shared with
 * the runtime request parsing, so the wire contract stays single-source.
