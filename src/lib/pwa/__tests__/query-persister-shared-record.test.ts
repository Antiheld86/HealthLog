/**
 * Nothing of somebody else's record reaches this device's disk, and nothing on
 * it is painted while somebody else's record is open.
 *
 * The full page reload a switch performs clears the in-memory cache. These two
 * layers are the ones it cannot reach: the IndexedDB snapshot, and (through
 * the same wipe helper) the service worker's read-data cache. Between them
 * they are the reason a switched browser can paint the previous record's
 * numbers with nothing in the page's own code being wrong — the answer would
 * not have come from the page.
 *
 * The IndexedDB here is a small fake rather than a mock of the persister's own
 * calls. A test that asserted "idbSet was not called" would prove the code
 * took a branch; this one proves the store is empty, which is the fact
 * somebody's privacy depends on.
 *
 * Mutation checks, both run:
 *   - delete the `isReadingSharedRecord()` guard in `flush` → "writes nothing
 *     to disk while inside another record" goes red, with the snapshot found
 *     in the store.
 *   - delete the guard in `restorePersistedQueryCache` → "restores nothing
 *     while inside another record" goes red on the cache-size line, with one
 *     entry hydrated. The line above it stays GREEN under that mutation, which
 *     is the point of having both: the record-scoped hash already makes the
 *     restored entry unreadable, so an assertion about readability alone would
 *     have reported success about a control that was no longer there.
