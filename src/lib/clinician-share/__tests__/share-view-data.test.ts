/**
 * v1.11.0 (Epic C, C8) — clinician-view scoped data load guarantees.
 *
 * The public clinician view aggregates ONLY the data the owner froze into the

 * default-OFF by construction: `loadShareViewData` calls the doctor-report
 * aggregator with the frozen window + section toggles and nothing else — no
 * identifier opt-in, no decrypt path. This test pins that contract so a future
 * change can't silently widen the clinician view to leak the KVNR.
