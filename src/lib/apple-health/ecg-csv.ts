 * indexing on the English keys found none of them, never crossed into the
 * waveform, and rejected the whole recording.
 *
 * Both maps below are OBSERVED, from real exports: nine keys and two verdicts,
 * consistent across every German file seen. The other four shipped languages
 * are deliberately ABSENT rather than guessed. A wrong key silently mis-files a
 * value and a wrong clinical verdict is worse than no verdict, so a localised
 * file this parser cannot place is refused — which is visible — instead of
 * being read into the wrong column, which is not.
 *
 * Adding a language is a data addition to these two maps and nothing else.
 *
 * Two gaps worth naming. No observed file carries an average-heart-rate row in
 * any language, so there is no localised key for it here. And every observed
 * localised file uses the single-column layout, so the paired layout's
 * `Lead,Voltage` column header has only ever been seen in English; its
 * translated form is unknown and is not invented here.

 * "Heart Rate Under 50" both landed on `null`, which the column cannot tell
 * apart from "this recording carries no classification at all".
 *
 * The English wordings below are OBSERVED, from a corpus of real Apple Watch
 * exports rather than taken from the framework's case names — the CSV writes a
 * display string, and it does not match the `HKElectrocardiogram.Classification`
 * identifiers. `InconclusiveHighHeartRate` reaches the file as "Heart Rate Over

 * tracks the watch generation, so the two heart-rate arms match the number

 * instructions-for-use document. They are verdicts the app can produce; a given
 * file may never carry one, but mapping a documented verdict is not the same as
 * leaving a branch in for a hypothetical caller.
 *
 * ## What is still unresolved, and why it is not guessed here
 *
 * The CSV is localised, and not only in this field — a German export writes
 * `Klassifizierung,Sinusrhythmus`, with the KEY translated too. A non-English
 * verdict therefore reaches the `unknown` arm below, and in practice it never
 * gets this far, because the localised metadata keys fail the parse earlier.
 * Translating a clinical verdict is not something to do from memory, so the
 * language half is deliberately left open and named rather than filled in.
