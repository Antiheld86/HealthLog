 * `health_score_algorithm:<v>` key unchanged. That is not cosmetic:
 * lengthening the key for everyone would leave every existing
 * acknowledgement pointing at a key nothing looks up, and the method
 * notice would reappear for every account on upgrade.
 *
 * The `health_score_algorithm:` prefix is deliberate — it is the
 * dismiss ledger's namespace (`isDismissibleItemKey`, the dismiss
 * route's score-cache eviction), not user-facing copy, and reusing it
 * is what lets the recipe notice ride machinery that already dismisses

 *
 * The third thing that can change what the number means, after the method
 * and the person's own recipe: a pillar stops counting on its own. A window
 * rolls past its floor, a module goes off, a source goes quiet — and the
 * level moves with nothing on the panel saying why. The delta is already
 * suppressed for exactly this case, which prevents a false "you dropped six
 * points" and says nothing about the six points.
 *
 * Keyed on the RESULTING set rather than on the day, and that choice is the
 * whole behaviour: a set that stays the same tomorrow resolves to the same
 * key, so a dismissal holds instead of the note reappearing every morning,
 * and the next real change hashes differently and raises it again. The cost
 * is that a set the person has already acknowledged stays acknowledged if
 * they later return to it — A → B, dismissed, B → A, B again is silent.
 * That is the honest reading of the dismissal: they have been told what a
 * score on set B rests on, and nothing about B has changed since.
 *
 * The ids are sorted before hashing, so the same set never produces two
 * keys through registry order alone, and the hash is truncated because the
 * key is an identity to compare, not a value to invert.
 *
 * A namespace of its own rather than a suffix under
 * `health_score_algorithm:` — dismissing "the rules moved" must not also
 * dismiss "a pillar left", and one prefix carrying both would make the two
 * indistinguishable to the ledger.
