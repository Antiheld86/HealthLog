/**
 * Every audit action a delegable write route emits has a verb line.
 *
 * The owner's activity view exists to answer "what did somebody else do in my
 * record". It answers that by mapping the audit action to a sentence, and
 * falling back to "made a change" for anything unmapped. A fallback is the
 * right behaviour for an action nobody anticipated; it is the wrong behaviour
 * for the actions this release deliberately admits.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical. The map was written against the action name the
 * canonical route uses, while the web client posts to a sibling route that has
 * audited under a different name since v1.0.0 — so the single most-used
 * delegated act, a caregiver marking a dose, rendered as the generic fallback
 * for the person whose tablets they are. Nothing failed; the sentence was just
 * vaguer than it needed to be, which is exactly the kind of defect no
 * behavioural test notices.
 *
 * So this reads the actions out of the routes rather than out of a list
 * somebody maintains beside them. A new delegable write whose action has no
 * sentence fails here, at the moment it is added.
 *
 * ## Why the AST
 *
 * Membership used to be `src.includes('requireRecordAuth("write")')` and the
 * action names came out of a regex. Both were satisfiable and both were
 * escapable by formatting alone: putting the argument on its own line — which
 * is what prettier does the moment the call grows a second one — dropped the
 * module out of the scan entirely, and a genuinely-red run went green with no
 * mapping added and nothing else changed. A guard a reformat can silence is
 * not a guard.
 *
 * Membership is decided by parsing now, through the module's own import table,
 * so an aliased or namespace-qualified resolver call resolves back to
 * `requireRecordAuth` and the argument is read off the call node rather than
 * off the neighbouring characters. The same walk finds the awaited `auditLog`
 * calls. `describe("the matcher sees what it looks for")` proves both halves
 * against synthetic modules.
 *
 * ## Why the counts below are of MATCHES
 *
 * The verdict this file returns is an EMPTY list, and an empty list is what a
 * matcher that matches nothing also returns. Counting the modules SCANNED
 * proved only that the directory walk worked — it stayed comfortably above its
 * floor while the membership test found no write routes at all. So the pins
 * are on the matched set: the write modules found, one of them named, and the
 * awaited audit actions read out of them.
