/**
 * Reminder dedup anchor — "this slot already went out today".
 *
 * The medication-reminder tick runs every 15 minutes and re-derives the
 * same overdue slot on every pass, so it needs a durable record of what it
 * already sent. That record used to be the Telegram message ledger, which
 * only exists when a Telegram send succeeded: a user on email, APNs or
 * ntfy had no row, so the tick re-sent the same overdue notice on every
 * pass for the rest of the local day.
 *
 * The anchor now lives in `notification_events`, a record-scoped event ledger
 * rather than a channel delivery record. Three properties matter and all are
 * deliberate:
 *
 *  - **Written per dispatched slot, not per successful send.** Anchoring
 *    on a delivered push would re-open the flood the moment a channel
 *    starts failing, which is the original defect wearing a new key.
 *  - **Written before the dispatch.** A crash mid-dispatch burns the slot
 *    for that phase rather than risking a repeat; the next phase still
 *    escalates, and the next local day starts clean.
 *  - **Claimed atomically.** A transaction-scoped advisory lock serializes
 *    same-key workers through the window check and append, while provider
 *    egress remains outside that short transaction.
 *
