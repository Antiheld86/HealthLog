 * v1.36.0 — the only writer of `Session.actingAsUserId`.
 *
 * The column is the cookie transport's acting-account carrier. Two things
 * write it and they are opposite acts: the switch endpoint points a browser
 * session at a record, and the end of a grant points every affected session
 * back at its own. Both live here rather than at their call sites so the
 * carrier has one writer, the same way it has one reader (the resolver in
 * `src/lib/api-handler.ts`). The structural guard in
 * `src/__tests__/acting-account-boundary-guard.test.ts` holds that shape: any
 * other file that so much as names the column fails it.
 *
 * Nothing here authorises anything. `pointSessionAt` writes an id its caller
 * has already proven, and the resolver re-checks the grant on every request
 * regardless — a value stranded here by a grant that has since ended confers
 * exactly nothing. The clearing below is therefore housekeeping, not
 * enforcement: it exists so a delegate's browser lands back in its own account
 * instead of on a wall of 403s. Enforcement already happened when the grant
 * row was stamped.
