/**
 * v1.37.0 — the server half of the record-session fence.
 *
 * The rule itself lives next door in `record-session-fence-contract.ts`, which
 * imports nothing so the browser bundle can name the same headers. This file is
 * the part that cannot be in a browser: it reads `next/headers`, it holds the
 * refusals, and it stamps the wide event that becomes the response echo.
 *
 * Three things happen on every call, and the order matters:
 *
 *   1. Read the two asserted headers.
 *   2. Stamp the context the request is ACTUALLY being served under onto the
 *      request-scoped wide event — on every call, pass or refuse. `apiHandler`
 *      turns that stamp into the response echo, and this is the only thing that
 *      ever stamps it. The alternative that looks equivalent is not: the wide
 *      event's `setActingAs` runs in exactly one place, inside
 *      `resolveSwitchedRecord`, so it never fires on the carrier-none path, on
 *      an actor surface, or on a public route — and a client rule of "2xx with
 *      no echo means discard" would then throw away every actor and public
 *      response, including the `/api/version` poll that runs on a timer.
 *   3. Refuse, or return.
 *
 * ─── The atomicity property, stated once ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The epoch compared here and the `actingAsUserId` the resolver is about to
 * serve under come from ONE `getSession()` row read — `findSessionByCookie`
 * loads the whole row and both fields are projected off it. So "the scope the
 * handler serves under" and "the epoch the fence validated" are the same fact
 * read at the same instant, not two reads a switch can land between. That turns
 * what would be a race window into a tautology, and it is why this function
 * takes an `AuthContext` instead of resolving a session of its own. Do not add
 * a second session read here for any reason.
 *
 * What that does NOT close, and nothing can: a request that has already passed
 * the fence when a switch commits still completes under the context it was
 * admitted with. Holding a lock across the handler's I/O would close it and was
 * examined and rejected during v1.37.0 planning — it buys a disclosure window
 * measured in milliseconds at the price of lock, pool, timeout and revocation
 * availability defects. What covers it instead is the response echo: the client
 * discards a response whose echoed context contradicts the one it is now on.
