/**
 * The manual-entry form offers every body-composition reading the server
 * accepts from a person (#1013).
 *
 * The form keeps a hand-written type list, and the server's list of
 * measurement types grew past it: visceral fat, fat mass, fat-free mass and
 * lean body mass all arrived from scales and Apple Health, with units and
 * plausibility ranges, while a person reading the same number off a scale's
 * display had no row to type it into. Nothing noticed, because nothing
 * compared the two.
 *
 * The comparison is derived from the server's own grouping
 * (`MEASUREMENT_CATEGORIES`, the "body" family), so a type added to that
 * family later fails here until it is either given a form row or named below
 * with the reason a person would not type it.
