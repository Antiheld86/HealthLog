/**
 * `<SettingsCard>` — the standard Settings card container.
 *
 * Every Settings section paints the same bordered surface: a rounded card
 * with the app's one card-padding contract (`p-4 md:p-6` — 16 px on phones,
 * 24 px from `md` up). Before this primitive the surface hand-rolled
 * `bg-card border-border rounded-xl border p-4 sm:p-6` in ~35 files, which
 * (a) bypassed the `<Card>` primitive entirely and (b) stepped padding at
 * `sm:` (640 px) instead of `md:` (768 px), so on a ~700 px tablet Settings
 * cards read denser than every other surface.
 *
 * The default renders the ui `<Card>` so the surface composes from one shape,
 * and like `<Card>` the card owns its internal rhythm: `flex flex-col gap-4`.
 * The header→body distance therefore comes from the container's gap, never
 * from a margin a call site remembers to add. It used to come from three
 * competing techniques at once — `mt-4` on the first body child (20 files),
 * `space-y-4` on the card (9), `mb-3`/`mb-4` on the header (2) — which is
 * exactly the drift that made neighbouring cards read as different systems.
 * A denser card overrides the gap on the card itself (`className="gap-2"`),
 * as `<Card>` documents; nothing else may re-declare the header→body step.
 *
 * Pass `className` for per-card extras (`scroll-mt-28`, `flex h-full`, …).
 *
 * `as="section"` keeps a card's semantic landmark element (a `<section>` with
 * an `aria-labelledby`) while painting the same shape, rhythm, and padding.
 *
 * `flush` is for the other body shape: an edge-to-edge `divide-y` ledger whose
 * rows carry their own inset. Such a card drops BOTH the padding and the gap.
 * Dropping only the padding is the trap — the gap survives as dead,
 * unclickable space between the rows that the first row does not have, so the
 * list reads a step off itself. `<InsightSectionCard flush>` names the same
 * shape on the Insights side.
