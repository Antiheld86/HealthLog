/**
 * The one line that says what the artefact will contain.
 *
 * This is the consent check: reading it IS the review. Fenced inclusions are
 * restated by name rather than folded into the count, because a number cannot
 * be checked at a glance and "incl. Mood, PHQ-9" can.
 *
 * On an empty scope it is also the reason the generate / create control is
 * disabled, which is why it takes an `id`: the control points its
 * `aria-describedby` here, so "why can I not press this" has an answer in the
 * accessibility tree as well as on screen.
 *
 * Meta tier — one sentence about the form beside it, not content.
 *
 * One per picker, so the test id ends with the same surface its picker does.
