/**
 * v1.4.16 phase B5c — shared chart-mini window vocabulary.
 *
 * The Oura-style RecommendationCard (B5c) embeds a mini-chart that
 * pins to the recommendation's `rationale.dataWindow`. This helper
 * maps the rationale enum onto the calendar-day window used by the
 * existing chart wrappers.
 *
 *   last7days  → 7-day window
 *   last30days → 30-day window
 *   last90days → 90-day window
 *   allTime    → 0 (HealthChart treats 0 as "no window — show all")
 *
 * The values mirror the existing `TIME_RANGES_KEYS` definition in
 * `health-chart.tsx`; the helper is a pure function so unit tests
 * pin the contract without depending on Recharts internals. The
 * exported name keeps the historical `rangePoints` vocabulary because
 * it feeds the chart state/preference field of that name (a persisted
 * wire field) — the VALUE has always been calendar days.
