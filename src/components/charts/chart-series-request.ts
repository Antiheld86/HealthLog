/**
 * Query string for one type's chart series (`GET /api/measurements`).
 *
 * Every range asks for one row per local calendar day. The 7-day range used
 * to ask for raw rows oldest-first under a 5 000-row limit; a per-minute
 * heart-rate stream holds 10 080 rows in seven days, so the answer stopped
 * half-way through the week and the newest days were silently missing. The
 * chart folds rows into days either way, so the daily answer draws the same
 * points while its size depends only on the number of days.
 *
 * Pure so the request the chart makes can be tested against the real route.
