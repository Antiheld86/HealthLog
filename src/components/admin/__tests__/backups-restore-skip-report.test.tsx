/**
 * The restore's skip report has to reach a human.
 *
 * The server names every catalogue key it could not resolve, in the response
 * and in the audit row, and the integration suite proves that end. This is the
 * other end: a report that a person never sees is the same silence the naming
 * exists to end, so the panel gets its own coverage rather than riding on the
 * fact that a state setter is wired up somewhere.
 *
 * Pinned here:
 *   1. every skipped key is printed, not just a total,
 *   2. each key carries its own link count and its catalogue,
 *   3. an empty report renders nothing at all — a panel that appears after a
 *      clean restore trains the operator to ignore it,
 *   4. the copy resolves in more than one locale, so a self-hoster running the
 *      German UI is told the same thing.
 *
 * Mutation check: total the links instead of listing them (drop the `<ul>`) and
 * cases 1 and 2 go red; return the panel unconditionally and case 3 goes red.
