/**
 * v1.36.0 — the strip that says whose record is open.
 *
 * This is the feature, not decoration around it. A caregiver who forgets they
 * are switched will log their own blood pressure into somebody else's record,
 * and there is no undo for a reading that was never theirs. So the banner
 * states three things in one line — that this is not your record, whose it is,
 * and what sharing level applies — and carries the way out beside them.
 *
 * ## Why it looks like this
 *
 * Loud on purpose, within the token system. `bg-warning/15` + `border-warning/40`
 * puts it in the one visual register the app reserves for "something about this
 * screen is not normal", above the offline strip and the demo strip in the
 * shell so it is the first line of chrome under any circumstance. Not
 * `destructive` — nothing is broken and nothing is at risk of being lost;
 * warning is the honest register for a context the user has to hold in mind.
 * Not a tint on the page background either: a subtle wash is exactly what
 * somebody stops seeing after the third switch, and the failure mode here is
 * a person who has stopped noticing.
 *
 * The name and qualifier both use `text-foreground`: the warning wash is too
 * dark for the muted token at this text size, while the foreground token keeps
 * the context legible at the same contrast floor as the name.
 *
 * The row is the inline-action shape from UI-STANDARDS §11 rather than a
 * centred wrapping stack: sentence `min-w-0 flex-1`, action `shrink-0`, so the
 * way out stays beside the sentence instead of dropping onto its own line once
 * the name is long. `<MaintainershipBanner>` is the sibling that already had an
 * action and already had this shape; the two now read the same. The tap target
 * carries the standard's floor (`min-h-11 sm:min-h-9`) — a person leaving
 * somebody else's record on a phone is the one interaction in the stack, and it
 * was a 32px target.
 *
 * Mounted for every authenticated route inside `<AuthShell>` (the
 * `<DemoBanner>` pattern) so no page can forget it, and rendered from
 * `accountAccess.active`, which the server resolves: the banner appears exactly
 * when the server says the session is inside a record, never on a client guess.
 *
 * `role="status"` rather than `alert`: assistive tech announces the context
 * once when it appears, without the interrupt an alert implies. `aria-live` is
 * left to the role's implicit `polite`.
