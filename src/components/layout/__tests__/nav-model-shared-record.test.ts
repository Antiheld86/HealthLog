/**
 * What the navigation offers inside somebody else's record.
 *
 * Paint, not enforcement — every route behind a hidden entry refuses on its
 * own, from a frozen allowlist this model cannot reach. What these pin is that
 * the line is drawn in ONE place: the mobile bar's fixed slots, the sidebar,
 * the More hub and the shell's deep-link guard all ask the same list, so they
 * cannot end up disagreeing about what a delegate is offered.
 *
 * The default is the safe one. A destination that says nothing about sharing
 * drops out, so a surface added later is hidden until somebody has thought
 * about it rather than exposed until somebody notices.
 *
 * Mutation check, run: flip the default in `isNavDestinationVisible` so an
 * unflagged destination survives a switch → "hides everything that has not
 * been classified" goes red naming Insights and the Coach.
 *
 * Mutation checks for the utility tail, run against `visibleUtilityDestinations`:
 *   - restore the old empty tail for every shared record → both "offers
 *     Settings" cases and the parity case go red (3);
 *   - point the switched entry at the fixed `/settings/account` → the adult
 *     MANAGE case and the parity case go red (2);
 *   - keep Notifications in the switched tail beside the remapped Settings
 *     entry → "never offers Notifications under a switch" goes red, with the
 *     two "offers Settings" cases and the parity case (4);
 *   - drop the manageable-section check from
 *     `isSettingsDestinationListedForRecord` → "offers no Settings entry to a
 *     MANAGE share whose sections do not include profile" and "keeps a
 *     managed profile's guardian configuration …" go red (2).
