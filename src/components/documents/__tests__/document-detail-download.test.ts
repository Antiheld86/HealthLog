/**
 * The detail sheet fetches the original once, and only when it will show it.
 *
 * Two regressions this pins, both introduced by the fix that moved these
 * controls off a bare `/api/…` href and neither visible in any rendered
 * assertion:
 *
 *   * **Two eager fetches per open.** `InlinePreview` loaded the original and
 *     the sheet-level download href loaded it AGAIN, so opening a document
 *     decrypted and held two copies of it — including for a non-inline
 *     document, where the old href cost nothing until somebody clicked. The
 *     vault meets large scans.
 *   * **A download control that could not be pressed and would not say so.**
 *     `href="#"` plus `aria-disabled` announces "unavailable" and still
 *     activates, and it ignored the failure flag entirely, so a permanently
 *     unfetchable original left a control that silently did nothing.
 *
 * Asserted on source shape rather than by rendering: the project's component
 * convention is SSR-only (no DOM, no testing-library), and both properties are
 * about which code paths EXIST — how many loaders there are, and whether the
 * disabled state is real. A render could not see either.
