 * separate, full-width sections (wellness lifted above the daily briefing,
 * vitals below it). Both surfaces read the same already-computed derived
 * values, so this hook owns the ONE batched `/api/insights/derived/batch`
 * request and hands its `read`/`isLoading`/`isError`/`refetch` handle to
 * both. A single cache entry, one network round-trip — never a per-section
 * fan-out (the v1.9.1 "hangs then recovers" symptom).
 *
 * The page mounts this once and passes the handle down, so the wellness
 * strip and the vitals dashboard share the same query instance.
