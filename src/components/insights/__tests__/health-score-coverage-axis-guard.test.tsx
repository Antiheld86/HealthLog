/**
 * Two claims the Health Score panel used to make about its own coverage
 * that were not true, held down structurally so a tidy-up cannot bring
 * either back.
 *
 * **1. `composite.coverage.presentInputs` counts DOMAINS, not pillars.**
 * `computeComposite` builds it from `eligibleDomains.size`. The panel fed
 * it into a sentence reading "{count} eligible pillars", so someone
 * recording blood pressure, glycaemia and lipids was told they had one
 * eligible pillar while looking at three. The count was right; the noun
 * was wrong, and a noun is exactly the thing a later cleanup restores
 * without noticing. The guard reads the call sites out of the AST, so it
 * fails on the value AND on the copy — passing the domain count into a
 * pillar-shaped string is caught wherever the string lives.
 *
 * **2. The composite's coverage fraction was a floor, not a proportion.**
 * `requiredInputs` is the three-domain recommendation and `deriveCoverage`
 * clamps `presentInputs` to it. Until v1.38 three domains were also the
 * price of a score, so every scored account rendered "3/3" forever,
 * whatever it recorded: a met floor presented as full coverage of the
 * person's own data. The composite's meter therefore names its axis, and
 * the guard fails if that override is dropped.
 *
 * **3. Since v1.38 the fraction is a real moving number, and the axis has
 * to move with it.** Two domains now score, so a scored account no longer
 * clears the recommendation by definition and the override cannot branch
 * on "is there a score" any more — that would tell a two-domain account it
 * covers the three areas the score recommends, which is claim 2 rebuilt one
 * floor higher. The branch is the breadth TIER: `full` states the
 * recommendation, everything narrower shows the fraction it can actually
 * count. The last block below renders the real panel at each tier rather
 * than reading the branch out of the source, because a branch that reads
 * correctly and renders the other arm is the failure this pair of claims
 * keeps producing.
 *
 * The first two are AST matchers rather than text searches, and both carry
 * a counter-test proving they stay quiet on the neighbouring call sites
 * that are legitimately about pillars.
