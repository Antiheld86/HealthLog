/**
 * Insights redesign hero strip.
 *
 * The wider band lifted from the design handoff
 * (`prototype/artboard-fullpage.jsx → BriefingHero`):
 *
 *   - locale-aware time-of-day greeting line ("Good morning, …" /
 *     "Guten Morgen, …") + a narrative subtitle (the briefing
 *     paragraph when one is cached, else a fallback)
 *   - personal-baseline + "Generated <relative-time>" meta row
 *   - Dracula gradient + soft purple glow via the new `.hero-gradient`
 *     + `.glow-purple` utilities in `globals.css`
 *
 * v1.18.7 — the overview "Ask the coach" action row + guided-questions
 * chip strip were removed from the band. The Coach lives in the
 * bottom-right drawer (mounted by the insights layout shell); the
 * overview now leads with the present-focused daily briefing, not a
 * coach prompt.
 *
 * The Health Score is back in the band's right column, where it lived for
 * eleven weeks. It is the score's ONLY mount on the overview — there is no
 * second card below the greeting any more. The band splits into two columns
 * from `md` up, and only when there is a score (or one on its way): an
 * account without a score keeps the full-width greeting exactly as it is.
 * Below `md` the panel stacks under the greeting at full width.
 *
 * Pure presentational — the page owns the briefing and the score data.
