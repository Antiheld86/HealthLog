 * {@link runRecordIntake}, the log-intake dialog through {@link runLogIntake},
 * and the dose-history ledger, which builds its own POST because it also has
 * an optimistic cache patch to make. All three showed the same success toast
 * and all three had to reach the same two conclusions:
 *
 *   - inside somebody else's record, name the record. "Saved" alone is the one
 *     confirmation a person acting for somebody else does not need.
 *   - and drop Undo there. A delegate may record a dose and may not remove
 *     one, so an Undo they can see is an Undo the server refuses.
 *
 * Two of the three learned that; the ledger did not, which is a delegate
 * meeting a dead Undo on every dose they mark. Three copies of one ternary is
 * how that happens, so there is one now.
