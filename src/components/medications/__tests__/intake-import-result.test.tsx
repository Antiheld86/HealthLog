/**
 * #650 — the intake import says what actually happened.
 *
 * The report was a file of 28 doses where 27 were "skipped" and the dialog
 * answered in success tone with a duplicate count, so nothing on screen said
 * the history had not landed. The cause is fixed elsewhere; this pins the
 * telling, which is what turned a recoverable problem into a silent one.
 *
 * Project convention is SSR-only component tests (vitest runs `node`;
 * `@testing-library/react` is not installed), so the view takes its state as a
 * prop and each case is rendered directly.
