/**
 * The dashboard HRV tile must accept either HRV type.
 *
 * HRV is stored under two measurement types that are not the same measure:
 * SDNN (`HEART_RATE_VARIABILITY`, Apple / Fitbit / Google Health) and nightly
 * RMSSD (`HRV_RMSSD`, Oura / Polar / WHOOP, and a bridge pushing a Garmin-style
 * feed). Every other HRV surface already unions them — `/insights/hrv` via
 * `fallbackMeasurementType`, the Coach via `COACH_SOURCE_MEASUREMENT_TYPES.hrv`,
 * the MCP reads via `withHrvFallback` — and `sub-page-metric.ts` states that
 * listing both is what keeps "the tab, pill, and dashboard tile lit whichever
 * source the user has".
 *
 * The tile did not. It read `summaries.HEART_RATE_VARIABILITY` alone, so an
 * RMSSD-only account got a Settings → Dashboard toggle that turned on and
 * rendered nothing, with no message, while `/insights/hrv` charted the same
 * readings. That asymmetry is what this file pins.
 *
 * Mutation check: return the fallback unconditionally and the "SDNN wins"
 * cases go red; drop the fallback arm and the RMSSD cases go red; return the
 * fallback's TYPE while returning the primary's summary and the freshness
 * case goes red.
