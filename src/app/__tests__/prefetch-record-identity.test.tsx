/**
 * Whose record a server-prefetching page serialises into the HTML.
 *
 * The prefetch is a server-side copy of what a route would answer. It is only
 * ever correct when the account the RSC read equals the account the client's
 * route would serve, and under an account switch those two are never the same
 * account:
 *
 *   - `getSession()` answers who is CALLING and deliberately never the record
 *     being acted on (`src/lib/auth/session.ts`), so the RSC read the
 *     delegate's own rows;
 *   - a NON-delegable route (`/api/user/thresholds`, `/api/mood/analytics`)
 *     refuses the refetch outright, so the seeded value is what stays on
 *     screen — under a banner naming somebody else;
 *   - a DELEGABLE route (`/api/dashboard/snapshot`, `/api/daily/digest`,
 *     `/api/dashboard/widgets`, `/api/measurements/series-batch`,
 *     `/api/medications`) answers with the owner's rows, so the same page
 *     paints two people at once until the refetch lands.
 *
 * The front-door reads moved from the first bullet to the second when `/` was
 * made usable under a switch. That changed which ending a bad prefetch has,
 * not whether it is one.
 *
 * These tests assert what reaches the cache, not which branch ran. Each one
 * reads the dehydrated queries off the returned `<HydrationBoundary>` and
 * checks the payload by a marker unique to the account it came from, so a
 * prefetch that seeds the wrong person fails here even if every guard around
 * it stays green.
 *
 * Mutation checks, run:
 *   - restore `getSession()` in `src/app/page.tsx` → "seeds nothing while the
 *     session is acting on another record" goes red, PRINTING the four cache
 *     cells it found, each carrying the delegate's marker.
 *   - restore it in `src/app/medications/page.tsx` → the medications leg goes
 *     red the same way, printing the delegate's list.
 *   - make `getUnswitchedSession` return the session regardless of the carrier
 *     → both go red at once, which is the whole feature failing in one place.
