 * The address book, one level under the checkups page the visits live on.

 * configures behaviour; a list of one's own doctors configures nothing and is
 * record content like every other clinical list. Sitting under `/checkups`
 * also means it inherits that page's route-family classification, so a
 * `profile`-scoped delegate reaches it exactly as they reach the visits.
