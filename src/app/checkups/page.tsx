/**
 * Thin RSC wrapper around the (client) checkups page.
 *
 * The page's above-the-fold content — the Vorsorge reminder list — waited for
 * the client `queryKeys.measurementReminders()` cell to fetch after hydrate,
 * so the first paint flashed a skeleton before the list filled in. This
 * wrapper runs the SAME read the API route uses (`listMeasurementReminders`,
 * shared so filter/order/DTO cannot drift) during SSR and hands it to
 * TanStack through `HydrationBoundary`.
 *
 * Contract notes (the v1.30.9 dashboard template):
 *  - The query key comes ONLY from the central factory —
 *    `queryKeys.measurementReminders()` is a deterministic zero-arg tuple, so
 *    the server-seeded key equals the client's `useQuery` key by construction.
 *  - The dehydrated VALUE is JSON-round-tripped so the hydrated shape is
 *    exactly what the client `queryFn` produces from the wire (ISO date
 *    strings), never a Date-carrying sibling that poisons the cell.
 *  - Only the PRIMARY read is prefetched. The visits tab mounts its own read
 *    lazily on first open, and that stays client-lazy on purpose — most
 *    visits to this page never open it.
 *  - Record identity: the session comes from `getUnswitchedSession()`, which
 *    answers null while the browser is acting on somebody else's record —
 *    the prefetch must never serialise the delegate's own reminders into a
 *    page opened on the owner's record.
 *  - Fail-soft: no session or a read hiccup renders the page exactly as
 *    before this wrapper existed — the client cell owns the fetch.
