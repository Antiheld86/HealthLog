/**
 * `GET /api/mental-health/assessments/[id]` — one screener administration WITH
 * its decrypted per-item answers.
 *
 * The list route beside this one denormalises total + band + item-9 flag for
 * cheap history reads and deliberately never touches `responsesEncrypted`.
 * Until this route existed nothing read the blob back at all (its only
 * consumer was key rotation), so the stored clinical detail — including the
 * PHQ-9 item-9 answer — was invisible to the person it belongs to. This is
 * the read side of that write.
 *
 * GATING — same declaration as the sibling list read (`read`, `mind`), on
 * purpose: the mind domain already serves decrypted free text at this level
 * (the mood entry's encrypted note on `GET /api/mood-entries/[id]`, the Coach
 * reminder notes), and the list read already publishes `item9Flagged` — the
 * fact that the self-harm item was answered non-zero. A delegate the owner
 * trusted with a mind-scope read grant therefore learns nothing here that is
 * categorically beyond what the domain already shows; splitting the per-item
 * values onto a stricter gate than the mood diary's prose would be an
 * inconsistency, not a protection. The module gate resolves against the
 * RECORD, so the surface stays unreachable wherever the owner keeps the
 * module off.
 *
 * DECRYPT FAILURES degrade honestly (the records-DTO fail-soft precedent):
 * `items: null` + `itemsUnavailable: true`, with the denormalised score
 * fields still answering — a key gap on one row never 500s the read. A
 * plaintext whose item count no longer matches the instrument degrades the
 * same way, because pairing answers to the wrong official item texts would be
 * worse than showing none.
