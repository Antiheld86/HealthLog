 * Retention windows, as the privacy dashboard states them.
 *
 * The audit window comes from `getAuditLogRetentionDays()` rather than from a
 * second parse of the same variable. It used to be re-implemented here with
 * its own default and its own floor, which is two implementations of one
 * disclosure — and this surface, the sharing panel and the purge job all quote
 * the number to the same person. A drift between them is a page telling
 * somebody their data is kept for a length of time it is not.
 *
 * The rest still parse locally so the dashboard never imports a pg-boss job
 * module. Off-host backup retention is operator infrastructure (not an app
 * setting), so it is disclosed as prose, not a number.
