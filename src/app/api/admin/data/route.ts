/**
 * Admin-only global wipe of every account's data.
 * Keeps users/passkeys so access to the app remains possible.
 *
 * The set of tables is not written here. It is declared once in
 * `@/lib/data-wipe/wipe-plan` — the same declaration the per-account wipe
 * reads — and held against `prisma/schema.prisma` by
 * `src/__tests__/data-wipe-completeness.test.ts` plus its admin-scope sibling,
 * so a model added to the schema cannot quietly land outside this wipe. It had
 * done exactly that: the inline list this route used to carry named nine
 * tables, written when nine was most of the schema, and stayed at nine while
 * the schema grew past a hundred. Laboratory results, documents, cycle logs,
 * journals, mood, workouts, sleep and Coach conversations all survived the
 * wipe an operator runs before handing the box on.
 *
 * `ADMIN_WIPE_MODELS` is `WIPE_MODELS` minus the entries in
 * `ADMIN_WIPE_EXEMPT`, and every survivor — sign-in credentials, instance
 * configuration, the delegation grants that keep managed profiles reachable —
 * carries its reason in that file.
