 * This route and the WHOOP one were the two that never got a limiter, while
 * `fullSync` drives the full measure-history walk against Withings' per-user
 * budget: a tight loop or a stolen native token could exhaust it and pin
 * Prisma. A baseline 5/60s bucket gates the route and the expensive `fullSync`
 * path carries a tighter 1/hour bucket of its own.
