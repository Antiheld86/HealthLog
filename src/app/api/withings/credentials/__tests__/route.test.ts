/**
 * `DELETE /api/withings/credentials` — disconnect honesty.
 *
 * The handler deletes the connection row (holding the encrypted OAuth access +
 * refresh tokens) before nulling the credential columns. That delete used to be
 * `.catch(() => {})`: on a real failure the handler carried on, nulled the
 * client id/secret, and returned `{ deleted: true }` while the token-bearing
 * row survived — the user is told they are disconnected and they are not.
 *
 * It now narrows to P2025 ("already gone", a genuine no-op) and rethrows
 * everything else. Withings had no test file at all, which is why this one
 * exists; the WHOOP and Fitbit twins carry the same shape.
