/**
 * `GET /api/cycle/calendar` — the resolved verdict actually reaches a client.
 *
 * Both ends of a payload field can be written correctly and the wire can still
 * carry nothing; this repo has shipped exactly that. So nothing here is
 * hand-built downstream of the route: the test seeds rows, calls the REAL
 * exported `GET`, reads the response body as text, parses it, and asserts on
 * what came back. The engine, the calendar builder, the verdict resolver, the
 * DTO mapping and the envelope all run for real.
 *
 * The scenario is the one that froze a cycle ring: several long observed
 * cycles push the predicted next start weeks into the future, so every day of
 * the gap carries a phase label and the raw count walks past the profile's
 * typical length. The verdict must stop counting and say how late the period
 * is — resolved against the USER's timezone day, not the process's.
