/**
 * `POST /api/account/grants/[id]/renounce` — the delegate hands the access back.
 *
 * The same transition as the owner's revoke, attributed to the other party:
 * `revokedBy = GRANTEE`, so the record can tell "she withdrew it" from "he
 * decided he no longer wanted it". Two facts, one column, because they are
 * answers to the same question and a trail that conflated them would misread
 * an ordinary handover as a fallout.
 *
 * Its own verb rather than a second meaning for DELETE. The owner's revoke and
 * the delegate's renunciation look identical in the database and are entirely
 * different acts; letting one endpoint mean both would put a `revokedBy`
 * decision inside a caller-identity check, which is exactly the sort of branch
 * that gets simplified later by somebody who does not know why it was there.
 *
 * Frictionless for the same reason as revocation, and cleaned up in the same
 * transaction: every session of theirs sitting inside that record leaves with
 * the grant, including the ones on other devices.
 *
 * Not delegable: bare `requireAuth()`, so this cannot be done while acting as
 * somebody else, and the delegate is the session user rather than a body field.
 * That costs a browser already inside the record one extra request — switch
 * out, then renounce — and the exchange is worth it. Grant management is the
 * one surface where a delegate acting as somebody else must have no reach at
 * all, and "except this one endpoint, which only ever reduces" is precisely
 * the kind of exception that gets widened by somebody who reads the exception
 * and not the reason. Ending the access is still one click; the client makes
 * the switch-back call on the way.
