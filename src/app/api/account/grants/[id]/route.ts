/**
 * `DELETE /api/account/grants/[id]` — the owner withdraws access.
 *
 * **No step-up, no typed confirmation, no second factor, no ceremony.** That
 * is a decision, not an omission: reducing access must never be harder than
 * granting it was. Everything else in this product that guards a destructive
 * act guards it because the act is hard to undo — this one is the undo. A
 * person who wants their health record closed to somebody gets it closed on
 * the first click, and if they change their mind the invitation costs one
 * request to send again.
 *
 * Enforcement is the delegate's next request, not their next login: the
 * resolver re-reads the grant every time, so seconds, not sessions. What this
 * route adds on top is that the delegate's browser leaves too — the same
 * transaction clears the acting-account carrier on every session of theirs
 * pointing at this record, so a delegate sitting inside it lands back in their
 * own account instead of on a wall of 403s under a banner still naming the
 * owner.
 *
 * Despite the verb, nothing is deleted. `revokeGrant` stamps `revokedAt` and
 * `revokedBy` on a row that stays, because "who had access, from when to when,
 * and who ended it" is a question a deleted row cannot answer. DELETE is the
 * right HTTP verb for "end this thing"; it is not a promise about storage.
 *
 * Not delegable: bare `requireAuth()` refuses under a switch, and the owner is
 * the session user, so a delegate can neither revoke somebody else's grant nor
 * hand their own to a third party.
