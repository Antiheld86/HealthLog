/**
 * `POST /api/account/grants/[id]/accept` — the delegate accepts an invitation.
 *
 * The handshake exists because being handed read access to somebody's health
 * record is not something to impose silently: an invitation confers nothing
 * until the person named on it says yes, which is why `isGrantActive` fails a
 * row with `acceptedAt IS NULL` and why this route is the only thing that can
 * set it.
 *
 * The acceptance is also the consent record. `acceptedAt` is stamped here and
 * never anywhere else, on the same row that carries who offered the access and
 * when it ended — one row, one history, no second receipt table to disagree
 * with it. The address the delegate accepted from is deliberately not part of
 * it: who and when is what a consent record has to answer, and an address kept
 * for the life of both accounts answers nothing further. The audit row below
 * still carries it, under `audit_logs`' own retention.
 *
 * Not delegable: bare `requireAuth()` refuses under a switch, so nobody can
 * accept an invitation while acting as somebody else. The delegate is the
 * session user, never a body field, and `acceptGrant` puts that id in the
 * `where` of a conditional update — so an invitation addressed to another
 * account matches nothing and is refused as not-yours rather than accepted by
 * the wrong person.
