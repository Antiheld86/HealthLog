/**
 * `POST /api/account/switch` — point this browser at a record, or back at its own.
 *
 * Cookie transport only. The Bearer carrier is a per-request header, and that
 * difference is not an inconsistency to be smoothed over: stamping a switch on
 * a long-lived token would make the credential itself ambient authority, and
 * the token has to keep meaning "this person" for as long as it exists. A
 * Bearer caller reaching this endpoint has misunderstood its own transport, so
 * it is refused rather than quietly ignored.
 *
 * An actor surface — `requireActorAuth()` — and it has to be, because this is
 * the way back. Under the fail-closed default every route refuses while a
 * switch is on; if this one did too, a switched browser could enter a record
 * and never leave it, which turns a read-only convenience into a trap. So the
 * mode is declared, and the declaration is narrow: the only row this handler
 * touches is the caller's own session.
 *
 * What it writes is a SELECTOR, not a permission. The grant is validated here
 * before the stamp so a client gets an immediate, honest refusal instead of a
 * switch that appears to work and 403s on the next page — but the stamp itself
 * authorises nothing, and the resolver re-checks the grant on every request
 * that follows. A value stranded here by a revocation seconds later confers
 * exactly nothing.
 *
 * v1.37.0 — unfenced, deliberately, and the reason is the same one that makes
 * it an actor surface: this is the way back. A session whose context cannot be
 * proved must still be able to leave the record it may or may not be in, and
 * fencing the exit would make an unprovable context unrecoverable.
 *
 * What it takes instead is an optional `expectedEpoch`, which turns the
 * selector write into a compare-and-set. Two tabs pressing the switcher at once
 * both name the epoch they saw; one `UPDATE` matches, the loser gets zero rows
 * and the same 409 the fence raises, and the browser reconciles through
 * `/api/auth/me` before retrying. That is the monotonic ordering a server-side
 * pending lease was proposed for, in one statement, with no intermediate state
 * for a crashed initiator to strand.
 *
 * An ABSENT `expectedEpoch` keeps the unconditional write, and the two halves
 * of what that means are worth stating together:
 *
 *   * It is reachable only by a bundle that predates the fence. The switcher is
 *     rendered from `/api/auth/me` data, so a fence-aware client has adopted a
 *     context before it can offer a switch at all — it never omits the field.
 *   * It can therefore clobber a concurrent fenced switch. That is accepted:
 *     the fenced tab's next request asserts an epoch the row no longer holds,
 *     it takes the 409, and it reconciles to the truth; the pre-fence tab
 *     reloads into a fence-aware bundle immediately afterwards. Fail-closed and
 *     self-healing, bounded to the deploy window.
