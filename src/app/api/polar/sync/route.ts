/**
 * Manually trigger a Polar sync for the current user (v1.32.28).
 *
 * Calls `syncUserPolarLegs` — the same entry point the hourly poll uses — so
 * both Polar legs run with the attribution rules that were built for them
 * (vitals then workouts, independent failure recording, one success stamp).
 * Reaching past it into `@/lib/polar/*` would run half the provider and get the
 * ledger wrong. The module graph behind this import bottoms out in the shared
 * Prisma client and constants, so it is safe on the request path.
 *
 * No body and no `fullSync` flag: there is no full-history arm to call.
 *
 * Rate-limited 5/60s per user, matching the hardened Fitbit / Google Health
 * routes.
