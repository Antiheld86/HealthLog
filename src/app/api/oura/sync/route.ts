/**
 * Manually trigger an Oura sync for the current user (v1.32.28).
 *
 * Until now Oura only ever synced on its hourly cron tick, so a user who could
 * see something was behind had no way to ask for a fresh pull.
 *
 * No body and no `fullSync` flag: `syncUserOura` has no full-history arm, and
 * the window is not the caller's to choose — the sync derives it from the
 * newest row it already holds, which is what makes a catch-up honest. Accepting
 * a `lookbackDays` here would hand an unvalidated cost knob to the client.
 *
 * Rate-limited 5/60s per user, matching the hardened Fitbit / Google Health
 * routes; a sync is a fan-out of upstream requests plus a batched write, so a
 * tight retry loop must not be able to pin Prisma or burn the Oura budget.
