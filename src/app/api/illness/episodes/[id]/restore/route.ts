/**
 * `POST /api/illness/episodes/{id}/restore` — un-tombstone a soft-deleted
 * episode (the delete-Undo affordance, v1.18.3).
 *
 * Clears `deletedAt`, so the episode — and its preserved day-logs + encrypted
 * note — re-surface in every read. A soft-delete keeps the row and its
 * children intact, so restore is a pure flag flip; nothing is re-created.
 *
 * Born-gated + owner-scoped + idempotent: restoring a live episode is a
 * no-op, and a foreign / unknown id seals existence as 404. This answers the
 * iOS restore-vs-re-create question (healthlog-iOS#30) — restore wins.
