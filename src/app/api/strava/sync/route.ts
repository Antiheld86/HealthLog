/**
 * Manually trigger a Strava sync for the current user (v1.32.28).
 *
 * Incremental by nature: Strava already carries a real cursor
 * (`stravaLastActivityAt` minus an overlap), so a manual run picks up wherever
 * the last one stopped. No `fullSync` flag — deep history belongs to the
 * connect-time backfill queue, which is self-converging and already gated.
 *
 * Rate-limited 5/60s per user, matching the hardened Fitbit / Google Health
 * routes; Strava's 200-req / 15-min cap leaves no room for a retry loop.
