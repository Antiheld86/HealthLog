/**
 * GET /api/dashboard/snapshot
 *
 * v1.7.0 W6 — unified above-the-fold first-paint payload for the web
 * dashboard. One `apiHandler`-wrapped GET that assembles every tile
 * field in a single round-trip via `buildDashboardSnapshot` so the
 * whole strip shares one completion moment instead of the legacy
 * four-cell waterfall (slim analytics + thick analytics + mood + widget
 * layout, each gated behind `/api/auth/me`).
 *
 * Cookie OR Bearer auth via `requireAuth()`; the dashboard is a
 * cookie-session surface but the route does not gate on it. `userId`
 * is narrowed from the resolved session — never a body field.
 *
 * The body is read-through `caches.analytics` (stale-while-revalidate
 * via `cachedSwr`) keyed `${userId}|dashboard-snapshot`, with a per-key
 * TTL of `SNAPSHOT_CACHE_TTL_MS` (>= the client's 120 s refetch
 * interval) so a scheduled refetch lands on a warm entry instead of
 * re-running the full builder on every tick. It still rides the
 * analytics bucket so a measurement / mood / medication write covers it
 * (see `src/lib/cache/invalidate.ts`): a measurement write marks the
 * bucket stale (the high-frequency iOS-sync path serves the prior
 * snapshot + warms a background recompute), while a widget reorder still
 * hard-evicts so the layout change paints synchronously. Per-sub-query
 * timings surface under `meta.snapshot.sub_*_ms` on the cache-miss path
 * so a regression is attributable without re-instrumenting.
 *
 * No LLM is reachable from the builder — the daily briefing is lifted
 * read-only from `User.insightsCachedText`. The nightly
 * `insight-pregenerate` cron keeps that cache warm.

  // grant does not cover — is void while a grant is whole-record and
  // all-or-nothing: there is no module the delegate may not read directly.

  // lands it is the first route to re-examine, and the re-examination is about
  // the builder's inputs, not about this line. What the payload does not carry
  // is as much the point: no credential, no integration endpoint, no
  // notification channel, and the briefing prose is lifted read-only off the
  // owner's own row rather than generated, so no provider is reachable here.

  // The cache cell keys on the resolved id, so the owner's snapshot lands in
  // the owner's cell and a delegated read neither reads nor poisons their own.
