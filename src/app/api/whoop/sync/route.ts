/**
 * Manually trigger a WHOOP sync for the current user (v1.11.0).
 *
 * Mirrors the Withings manual-sync route: incremental by default, full
 * history when `{ fullSync: true }` is posted.
 *
 * Rate-limited on both arms, matching the Fitbit / Google Health siblings.
 * This route and the Withings one were the two that never got a limiter, while
 * `fullSync` drives the full four-resource history walk against WHOOP's
 * per-user budget: a tight loop or a stolen native token could exhaust it and
 * pin Prisma. A baseline 5/60s bucket gates the route and the expensive
 * `fullSync` path carries a tighter 1/hour bucket of its own.
