/**
 * POST /api/auth/reproof
 *
 * A browser session re-proves a credential the account holds, so that for the
 * next five minutes it may export the whole record, make a share link, mint a
 * token, or run an admin backup, restore, wipe or reset. Those routes answer
 * 401 `auth.reproof.required` with `meta.methods` when the session carries no
 * recent proof; the web opens the re-proof dialog, posts the proof here, and
 * retries.
 *
 * What a proof stamps on the session row:
 *   - `totp`, `webauthn` or `passkey`: `mfaVerifiedAt` and `reproofAt`. The
 *     same stamp a completed second factor or passkey sign-in writes, from the
 *     same factor, so it also clears the fresh-factor routes, exactly as
 *     signing in again would.
 *   - `password`: `reproofAt` only. Accepted only on an account without a
 *     second factor; an account with one is told which proofs it can give
 *     instead (422 `auth.reproof.too_weak`), because a password has never
 *     stood in for the second factor.
 *
 * Cookie-only. The Bearer transport has its own proof flow (`POST
 * /api/auth/step-up`, token-bound single-use elevations), and a stamp on a
 * session row means nothing to a token.
 *
 * GET asks the same question the gated routes ask, without acting: 200 when
 * the session's proof is recent, otherwise the same 401 `auth.reproof.required`
 * with `meta.methods`. The web calls it before a large upload, so the file is
 * not sent twice around a re-proof.
 *
 * Proofs draw on the account's shared re-proof budget (five per fifteen
 * minutes, the same bucket as the step-up mint and the enrollment routes) and
 * every refusal is audited. Failures are indistinguishable on the wire.
