/**
 * `PATCH /api/auth/passkeys/{id}` — the rename's refusal has to name the field.
 *
 * The handler used to answer `apiError("Invalid request", 422)` and throw the
 * Zod issues away, which is the one thing every sibling body-parsing route in
 * this tree does not do. A person renaming a passkey to an empty string and a
 * person pasting 200 characters got the same three words, so the form had
 * nothing to put beside the field and no way to say which rule was broken.
 *
 * These cases pin the multi-issue envelope by its CONTENT — the issue list has
 * to be present and has to point at `name` — rather than by status alone. A
 * status-only assertion would have passed against the flat error it replaced.

/**
 * The removal's gate, and the one option that keeps it from being a dead end.
 *
 * A passkey is the primary sign-in credential and it came off a plain session,
 * while the second-factor key next door demanded a fresh proof. The route now
 * asks the same gate that one asks, at the same strength — `freshFactor: true`,
 * not a softer mode. What it adds is `proofSource: "any-possession"`, and that
 * is the whole design: the gate's reachability pre-check counts second factors,
 * and a passkey-only account holds none, so the default question would have
 * refused `mfa_not_enrolled` to an account that was holding the proof the gate
 * accepts. A passkey stamps `mfaVerifiedAt` on login and is a `passkey`-method
 * mint arm; the pre-check simply was not asking about it.
 *
 * The gate itself is behavioural and lives against a real database in
 * `tests/integration/step-up-elevation.test.ts` (E14). What is pinned here is
 * what this file can prove without one: the route asks both halves of the right
 * question, and it spends the proof only when it is about to delete.
 *
 * Mutation check: drop the `proofSource` option and the first case goes red;
 * move `commitElevation()` above the ownership check and the third goes red;
 * drop it altogether and the second goes red.
