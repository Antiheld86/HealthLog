/**
 * POST /api/auth/me/mfa/totp/setup
 *
 * Begin TOTP enrollment. Generates a 160-bit secret, stores it **encrypted**
 * (AES-256-GCM, the same at-rest envelope as every other credential), and
 * returns the `otpauth://` URI + the raw Base32 secret so the client can
 * render the QR and offer manual entry. The secret is **pending** — MFA is
 * not active until `/confirm` verifies a code, so `totpConfirmedAt` stays
 * null here.
 *
 * Gated by `requireMfaManagementAuth`: a cookie session, or a Bearer token
 * presenting a single-use step-up elevation minted against a re-proved factor.
 * A token on its own can still never enrol MFA.
 *
 * A cookie session on its own cannot either. Enrolling hands the caller a
 * factor that later satisfies every step-up gate, so a stolen session must not
 * be able to mint one: the cookie arm also passes `checkCookieEnrollmentProof`
 * — a sign-in or second factor inside the last five minutes, or a password /
 * factor proof in the body (the step-up mint's shapes). The Bearer arm already
 * carries that proof in its elevation. The recovery-code batch is
 * issued at `/confirm` (after the factor is proven), not here, so an abandoned
 * setup never persists codes.
