/**
 * POST /api/auth/step-up
 *
 * Re-prove a factor and receive a single-use, token-bound step-up elevation for
 * one second-factor-management call.
 *
 * WHICH factor is re-proved decides WHAT the elevation reaches. `password`
 * reaches exactly what a plain cookie session reaches. `totp`, `webauthn`, and
 * `passkey` additionally satisfy the fresh-factor routes — disable, recovery-code
 * rotation, security-key removal — and that set is precisely the set of
 * ceremonies for which the web stamps a session second-factor-verified. If a
 * password-proved elevation opened those routes, a stolen token plus the account
 * password would rotate the recovery codes (which take no factor in the body)
 * and then spend one of them to disable the second factor outright.
 *
 * This is the whole point of the mechanism, so it is worth being blunt about
 * what it is not: it is NOT a way to turn a token into a stronger credential.
 * Presenting the token gets you as far as this endpoint and no further — the
 * body must carry a fresh proof of the account password or of a primary passkey
 * the device holds. A stolen token can call this all day and mint nothing.
 *
 * Bearer-only (`requireBearerAuth`). A browser cannot reach it even with a valid
 * session, which keeps an ambient cookie credential out of the mint path
 * entirely.
 *
 * Failures are deliberately indistinguishable. A wrong password, an account with
 * no password set, a passkey belonging to someone else, a stale challenge — all
 * return the same 401 with the same prose. The audit row carries the real reason;
 * the wire carries none of it.
