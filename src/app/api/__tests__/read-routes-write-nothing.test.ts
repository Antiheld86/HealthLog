/**
 * Structural guard: the three read routes that used to write must stay reads.
 *
 * `src/lib/api-handler.ts` states the invariant next to `READ_HTTP_METHODS` —
 * an MCP-audience token is admitted on GET/HEAD/OPTIONS on the REST surface
 * because those methods are assumed side-effect-free, and adding a
 * side-effecting GET silently widens that token's reach. These three routes
 * each broke it once. The runtime tests beside each route prove the specific
 * write is gone; this one fails on a NEW one.
 *
 * Deliberately scoped to these three files and to writes issued directly in
 * the handler. A repo-wide version is not written today because it cannot be
 * written without false positives: several read routes call helpers that
 * legitimately upsert a lazily-created row (`getOrCreateCycleProfile` behind
 * `requireCycleEnabled` is the clearest one), and a text matcher cannot tell
 * that apart from a real side effect. Widening this guard means resolving
 * those cases first, not loosening the pattern.
