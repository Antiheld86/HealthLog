/**
 * `/coach/plans` with the Coach unavailable.
 *
 * Plans are the person's own record. Before v1.39 the page redirected to
 * `/insights` as soon as the Coach was unavailable, so a person whose Coach
 * the operator switched off could neither read nor erase what it had kept.
 * Now the page stays and turns read-only: every plan is listed and can be
 * removed, while confirming or moving one (Coach use, refused by the PATCH
 * route) is not offered.
