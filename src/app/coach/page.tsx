/**
 * Thin RSC wrapper around the (client) full-page Coach.
 *
 * The default new-chat hero path carries the one genuine sequential waterfall
 * on this route: the client `coachNudgeStatus` cell fetches
 * `/api/insights/coach/nudge-status` after hydrate, and the conversation's
 * `autoOpenMostRecent` decision is gated on that result — so the hero "pops in
 * after a beat" while the nudge round-trip resolves. This wrapper runs the SAME
 * read the API route uses (`readCoachNudgeStatus`) during SSR and hands it to
 * TanStack via `HydrationBoundary`, so the auto-open decision is available at
 * hydrate and the waterfall step collapses.
 *
 * Contract notes (the v1.30.9 dashboard template):
 *  - The query key comes ONLY from the central factory —
 *    `queryKeys.coachNudgeStatus()` is a deterministic zero-arg tuple, so the
 *    server-seeded key equals the client's `useQuery` key by construction.
 *  - The dehydrated VALUE is JSON-round-tripped; the read already returns ISO
 *    strings, so the shape is byte-identical to the client's
 *    ((await res.json()).data) wire.
 *  - The client cell carries `staleTime: 5min` with the default
 *    `refetchOnMount`, so the seeded fresh value is used at hydrate without an
 *    immediate refetch. When the client query is disabled (a `?c=`/`?doc=`/
 *    `?scope=` deep-link makes it `enabled: false`) the seeded value simply
 *    sits unused — harmless.
 *  - Availability parity: prefetch only when the `coach` capability is
 *    available for the caller's own record, resolved from every layer (the
 *    operator switch, the `disableCoach` opt-out, provider presence and
 *    consent) by the same resolver the API routes use. An unavailable Coach
 *    does no wasted work. The seeded value carries the same `ai` state the
 *    nudge-status route returns, so the hydrated shape equals the wire.
 *  - Left CLIENT-LAZY on purpose: the streaming conversation itself (the SSE
 *    thread, snapshot, any provider-touching path) is NOT prefetched or warmed
 *    — it depends on URL params + the nudge outcome and must never be triggered
 *    server-side.
 *  - Record identity: the session comes from `getUnswitchedSession()`, which
 *    answers null while the browser is acting on somebody else's record. Every
 *    read below scopes to the CALLER, so under a switch the prefetch would
 *    serialise the delegate's own rows into a page opened on the owner's
 *    record. The accessor's docblock carries the argument.
 *  - Fail-soft: no session, the Coach being off, or a DB blip renders the page
 *    exactly as before this wrapper existed — the client cell owns the fetch.
