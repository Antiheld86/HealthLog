/**
 * Thin RSC wrapper around the (client) mood page.
 *
 * The page's primary content — the mood management list — waited for the
 * client `queryKeys.moodEntriesList(…)` cell to fetch the first page after
 * hydrate, so the first paint flashed a skeleton before the entries filled
 * in. This wrapper runs the SAME read the API route uses
 * (`listMoodEntriesPage`, shared so filter/order/wire shape cannot drift)
 * with the list's first-mount defaults during SSR and hands it to TanStack
 * through `HydrationBoundary`.
 *
 * Contract notes (the v1.30.9 dashboard template):
 *  - THE CRUX — the list key is parameterised. The seeded tuple spells the
 *    client's first-mount state exactly: no filters, page 1, the default
 *    `moodLoggedAt desc` sort, and `MOOD_LIST_PAGE_SIZE` rows (the shared
 *    constant the client's `queryFn` also uses). Any other page/filter state
 *    keys a different slot and fetches client-side as before.
 *  - The dehydrated VALUE is JSON-round-tripped so the hydrated shape is
 *    exactly what the client `queryFn` produces from the wire (ISO date
 *    strings, decrypted note as plain `note`), never a Date-carrying sibling
 *    that poisons the cell.
 *  - Module-gate parity: the client page redirects when `modules.mood` is
 *    explicitly `false`; skip the prefetch then (the client never mounts the
 *    list).
 *  - Record identity: the session comes from `getUnswitchedSession()`, which
 *    answers null while the browser is acting on somebody else's record —
 *    the prefetch must never serialise the delegate's own entries into a
 *    page opened on the owner's record.
 *  - Fail-soft: no session, a module lookup hiccup, or a read hiccup renders
 *    the page exactly as before this wrapper existed — the client cell owns
 *    the fetch.
