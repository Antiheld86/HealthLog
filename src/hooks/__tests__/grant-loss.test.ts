/**
 * Leaving a record the server has stopped honouring.
 *
 * Revocation clears the delegate's acting sessions in the same transaction, so
 * that path puts the browser back by itself. Expiry does not — nothing sweeps,
 * the grant simply stops being live on the next request, and the session keeps
 * its stamp. From then on every read is a correct 403 under a banner that says
 * the person is somewhere they are not.
 *
 * The subscriber is what closes that. It runs against a real `QueryClient`
 * here, driven into the error state the way a failing read drives it, because
 * "the effect calls subscribe" is a claim about source and "the callback fires
 * when a read is refused" is the behaviour somebody depends on.
 *
 * Mutation check, run: widen the guard to fire on any error (drop the
 * `isSharingAccessDenied` test) → "ignores an ordinary failure" goes red.
