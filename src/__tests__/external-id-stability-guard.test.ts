/**
 * Structural guard on the external-id stability floor.
 *
 * A client-supplied `externalId` is half of every ingest dedup key. An id
 * that rotates between client launches never matches its own earlier row,
 * so each sync sweep mints a fresh record — the failure mode that filled a
 * live instance with phantom medications, one per sweep, none of which
 * could ever collect a dose.
 *
 * The fix is only durable if it cannot be bypassed by the NEXT route.
 * These guards freeze the two legal ways to accept the field:
 *
 *   1. the request schema routes it through `assertStableExternalId`, so
 *      the refusal rides the standard 422 multi-issue envelope; or
 *   2. the field is deliberately permissive because a schema-level refusal
 *      would fail a whole batch on one bad row — in which case the
 *      declaration carries an `@external-id-checked-per-entry: <path>`
 *      marker naming the file that runs `classifyExternalId` per entry,
 *      and this guard verifies that file really does.
 *
 * They are tripwires, not proofs. A reviewer who waves through a bad
 * addition defeats them, and no test substitutes for that review.
