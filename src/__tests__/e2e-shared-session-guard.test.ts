/**
 * Structural guard on the E2E suite's session boundary.
 *
 * Account switching is stamped on the session row, not held in the tab. Every
 * Playwright context opened from `STORAGE_STATE_PATH` carries the SAME session
 * cookie, so a spec that switches that jar into another account's record
 * switches it for every spec authenticating with it — and the suite runs
 * `fullyParallel`. The failure lands in an unrelated file: a settings surface
 * painting "Not part of shared access", an axe scan reading a banner its spec
 * never asked for, a `waitForResponse` on a request the refused surface never
 * sends. Nothing in the spec that fails is wrong, and nothing in its file
 * explains it.
 *
 * So: a spec that switches accounts uses its own jar. This file holds that
 * shape by matching the two things a switching spec cannot avoid naming — the
 * menu entry it clicks and the endpoint that entry calls.
 *
 * It is a tripwire, not a proof. A future spec could switch through a control
 * neither marker names, and this guard would not see it; the counter-check
 * below is what stops the matchers from quietly matching nothing.
