/**
 * The time-of-day greeting has ONE evaluator.
 *
 * The dashboard header and the insights hero both open with a salutation
 * bucketed by the wall-clock hour. For a long time three different pieces
 * of code answered "what hour is it":
 *
 *   - the dashboard snapshot builder, which computed a `greetingHour` in
 *     the user's zone and shipped it on the payload "so the client never
 *     has to run its own Intl" — and which no client ever read;
 *   - the insights hero, through the shared `hourInTz` (profile zone,
 *     Europe/Berlin when the zone will not resolve);
 *   - the dashboard header, through a local helper that fell back to the
 *     DEVICE clock whenever the zone would not resolve.
 *
 * At one instant, for one account, those three returned 20, 21 and 05.
 *
 * The server value lost. It is not a derived fact about the record, it is
 * a clock read, and the snapshot body is served stale-while-revalidate for
 * up to an hour — long enough for a baked-in hour to name a salutation the
 * clock had left behind. What the server IS authoritative for is the zone,
 * and that already reaches every client on the same payload.
 *
 * This guard fails if either end drifts back:
 *   T1 — the snapshot builder or its OpenAPI schema starts carrying a
 *        greeting hour again.
 *   T2 — a greeting surface reads a clock that is not `hourInTz` — the
 *        device zone via `Date#getHours`, or a hand-rolled `Intl` walk.
 *   T3 — behaviourally, the shared helper stays on the profile zone even
 *        when the device sits elsewhere and the zone will not resolve.
 *
 * T1/T2 are grep-shaped and assert a non-zero match count, so an empty
 * sweep fails loudly instead of passing silently.
