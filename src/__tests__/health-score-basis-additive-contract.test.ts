/**
 * v1.38 — `scoreBasis` is additive on every wire it rides, and stays so.
 *
 * The block is new on three shapes that already ship: the full score
 * report's composite, the dashboard snapshot's flattened hero block, and
 * the daily digest's score. All three are `additionalProperties: false`,
 * and two of the three are served out of a CACHE — a snapshot or digest
 * written before this release has no way to grow a field. Declare
 * `scoreBasis` as required on any of them and every cached payload in
 * existence becomes invalid against the document that describes it on
 * the day the document is published, with nothing failing anywhere: the
 * generator is happy, `openapi:check` is happy, and the only symptom is
 * a strict client-side decoder rejecting real responses.
 *
 * That is the class this file pins. Every carrier must declare the
 * property (so a registry edit that drops it is not a green pass), must
 * NOT list it in `required`, and must point at the one shared component
 * rather than a fourth hand-rolled copy of the same object. The fields
 * that shipped before it stay required, because "additive" is a claim
 * about both directions.
 *
 * The document is BUILT rather than read off disk, the way the sharing
 * components guard does it: `scripts/check-openapi.ts` already pins
 * `docs/api/openapi.yaml` to exactly this document and CI fails on
 * drift, so building it here checks the same artifact without parsing
 * two megabytes of YAML.
 *
 * ## Mutation check
 *
 * Drop `.optional()` from any of the three registry declarations and the
 * matching `required` assertion goes red. Delete a declaration entirely
 * and the presence assertion goes red first.
