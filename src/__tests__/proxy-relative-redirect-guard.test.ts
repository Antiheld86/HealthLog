/**
 * A redirect must not name the host the process happens to be bound to.
 *
 * `NextResponse.redirect()` requires an absolute URL, and the obvious way to
 * build one is `new URL("/somewhere", req.url)`. Behind a reverse proxy that
 * does not pass `Host` through, `req.url` is the bind address, so the redirect
 * comes back as `https://0.0.0.0:3000/...`. A browser cannot follow it and iOS
 * refuses the port outright.
 *
 * It shipped on the native sign-in handoff, which is the primary onboarding
 * path. Two things made it invisible:
 *
 *   - every error branch of that route builds a fixed `healthlog://` scheme
 *     with no host in it, so the route was correct on every failure and broken
 *     only on success, and
 *   - a test that builds its own `Request` names a host that matches, so the
 *     absolute URL it produced looked right.
 *
 * This file therefore checks the two halves separately. The behavioural test
 * calls the real route with a request whose own URL points somewhere the
 * public origin is not, which is what a proxy hop looks like from inside the
 * handler. The structural test freezes the pattern out of the four files that
 * had it, because a behavioural test can only cover the route somebody
 * remembered to write one for.
 *
 * Mutation check: put `NextResponse.redirect(new URL("/auth/login?flow=native",
 * req.url))` back in the login route and both tests fail, the first on the
 * host appearing in `Location` and the second on the file list.
