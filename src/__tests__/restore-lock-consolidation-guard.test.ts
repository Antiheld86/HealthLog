/**
 * Every day transaction of the consolidation family holds the account
 * against a restore before it touches a reading (`restore-lock.ts`).
 *
 * The passes built on `runConsolidation` fold an account a day at a time, and
 * each day's transaction takes row locks on the account's readings. A restore
 * deletes all of them in one statement. Without a common first lock the two
 * take the same rows in different orders and deadlock (#1031, pinned end to
 * end by `tests/integration/restore-consolidation-deadlock.test.ts` for the
 * step consolidation). This guard extends the rule to every pass on the same
 * base, present and future: each file that calls `runConsolidation` must open
 * every transaction it starts with `holdAccountAgainstRestore(tx, …)`.
 *
 * The matcher is whitespace-tolerant and the file and transaction counts are
 * asserted to be non-zero, so a pattern that matches nothing fails instead of
 * passing.
