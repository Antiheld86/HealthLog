/**
 * Structural guards on the record-session fence.
 *
 * The behavioural proofs live in `src/lib/sharing/__tests__/record-session-fence.test.ts`
 * (the verdict and the refusals), `tests/integration/record-session-fence.test.ts`
 * (a refusal before any database work, with a positive control) and
 * `tests/integration/record-session-fence-idempotency.test.ts` (a refusal above
 * the replay cache). Those prove what today's code does. This file freezes what
 * tomorrow's may not do, because the fence has one shape that makes it worth
 * anything:
 *
 *   * exactly two auth helpers consult it, and both consult it BEFORE they read
 *     a carrier or look up a grant;
 *   * the helpers that deliberately do not consult it still do not;
 *   * one file writes the epoch and a closed list reads it;
 *   * the header names live in four files and no fifth: declared in the contract
 *     module, read by the server fence, attached by the browser transport, and
 *     published by the OpenAPI route module.
 *
 * ## What these matchers cannot see
 *
 * Everything here is a text match over source, so the guard's own limit is
 * worth writing down the way `session-surface-guard.test.ts` writes down its
 * own: **a fence bypass under a different header name would slip every matcher
 * below.** A future module that read `x-healthlog-record-context` and made its
 * own admission decision would be invisible here, exactly as the share-link
 * tree was invisible to a sweep that grepped only for `getSession`. The header
 * leg pins the names that exist; it cannot pin the ones that do not yet.
 *
 * Nor can it prove ordering at runtime. The placement legs compare source
 * offsets inside a function body, which is a proxy for execution order and
 * holds only because neither call sits inside a branch. The runtime property —
 * "no grant was looked up" — is proved by the integration file's `lastUsedAt`
 * and `sharing.record.accessed` instruments and by the `findActiveGrant`
 * zero-call spy, not here.
 *
 * Every leg asserts a non-zero match count before it asserts a set, because a
 * guard whose matcher finds nothing reports success, and this repository has
 * shipped several of those.
