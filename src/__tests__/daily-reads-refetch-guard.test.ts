/**
 * Structural guard on the "stale Today hero / dashboard after a write" class.
 *
 * The daily reads — `dailyDigest()` (Today hero) and `dashboardSnapshot()`
 * (dashboard) — run with `refetchOnMount: false` and a 120 s poll. A mutation
 * that invalidates one of the daily-reads-bearing bundles
 * (`medicationDependentKeys` / `measurementDependentKeys` / `moodDependentKeys`)
 * with the DEFAULT `refetchType: "active"` only refetches MOUNTED queries — so a
 * write made from a surface where the daily reads are UNMOUNTED (the medications
 * page, a detail page, the mood/measurement forms) marks them stale but never
 * refetches them. Returning to `/` then serves the pre-write cache until the
 * poll ticks or the tab is hard-reloaded.
 *
 * The blessed contract is `refetchInactiveDailyReads(queryClient)` (or its
 * wrapper `invalidateMedicationReads`), which forces the two inactive reads to
 * refetch. This class has recurred THREE times (v1.16.11 snapshot, v1.29.1
 * digest, v1.32.19 "Take all due") because the bundle cannot express
 * `refetchType`, so every new call site re-decides it by hand. This guard makes
 * a fourth recurrence fail CI.
 *
 * Like the Bearer-scope guard, this is a tripwire, not a proof. It cannot show
 * an allowlisted exception is correct — only that no NEW site invalidates a
 * daily bundle without the paired refetch, and no PAIRED site loses its refetch,
 * without someone editing this file.
 *
 * Both matcher families were proven live by breaking a real fix and watching
 * the guard go red: removing the `refetchInactiveDailyReads` pairing from the
 * illness invalidator (`components/illness/use-illness.ts`) failed the bundle
 * assertion, and reverting the score-config save
 * (`components/settings/score-section.tsx`) to its former bare
 * snapshot/digest `invalidateQueries` pair failed the direct-invalidation
 * assertion. Both fixes were then restored and the guard re-ran green.
