/**
 * v1.32.36 — pair guard binding `prisma/schema.prisma`'s `Measurement` model to
 * the disaster-recovery backup select.
 *
 * The failure it exists to catch: a column is added to the model in one release
 * and the backup select is "the follow-up". Nothing fails — the backup keeps
 * building, the restore keeps parsing (the payload schema is `.passthrough()`),
 * and the column simply comes back NULL on every restored row. That is how the
 * aggregation provenance was silently dropped from every disaster-recovery
 * backup between the release that added it and the one that noticed.
 *
 * Both ends of this comparison are literals — a Prisma model block and a named
 * select object — so the matcher is exact. No grep heuristics, no fuzzy name
 * matching, nothing that can quietly over-accept. That soundness is the reason
 * this guard is worth having as a gate while the broader "does any column have
 * a reader" question is only worth a release-battery script.
 *
 * Scoped to `Measurement` on purpose. Extend it model by model as each becomes
 * backup-relevant; converting every model at once buys exclusion-list churn
 * rather than safety.
 *
 * Mutation check: comment out `sleepStage: true` in `MEASUREMENT_BACKUP_SELECT`
 * and this goes red naming that column; add a scalar to the model without
 * adding it to the select and it goes red naming the new one.
