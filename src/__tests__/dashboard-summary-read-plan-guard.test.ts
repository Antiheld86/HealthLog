/**
 * Structural guards on the two per-type reads behind the dashboard tiles.
 *
 * A database audit against a multi-year account measured both of them as
 * full passes over the largest tables on the dashboard path. The cause is
 * the same in both cases: PostgreSQL 16 has no index skip scan, so a
 * query that wants one row per measurement type but never names a type
 * cannot be served by any index on `(user_id, type, …)` and falls back to
 * reading everything the account owns.
 *
 * Neither shape is a bug a behavioural test can see — both return the
 * right rows. What changes is the plan, and the plan is decided by two
 * properties of the SQL text: that the latest-reading read is driven FROM
 * the type list rather than grouped down to it, and that the rollup read
 * carries a `type` predicate at all. So the guards assert on the SQL.
 *
 * They are tripwires, not proofs. They cannot show a plan is good — only
 * that the two shapes the audit found have not come back. The measured
 * plans live in the integration companion
 * (`tests/integration/dashboard-summary-reads.test.ts`), which runs the
 * same functions against a real Postgres.
