/**
 * Every web request to an AI route is behind the `ai` capability map, and no
 * web code reads the retired switch projection.
 *
 * Since v1.39 the web renders every AI surface from one answer, the `ai`
 * block on `GET /api/auth/me`, read through `useAiCapability`. Two ways back
 * to the old behaviour are frozen here:
 *
 *   1. Reading `GET /api/feature-flags` (or the deleted `useFeatureFlags`
 *      hook). The projection knew only the operator's switches, not the
 *      person's opt-out, the provider or the consent, and it failed open, so
 *      AI chrome flashed and fired refusals before the switch set arrived.
 *   2. A request to an AI route from a module nobody gates. Each such module
 *      is on `AI_REQUEST_SITES` with the capability that decides it and the
 *      file that reads that capability; the guard proves the file does read
 *      it. A new module that requests an AI route without an entry fails by
 *      name.
 *
 * Matchers are whitespace-tolerant (`useAiCapability ( "coach" )` counts) and
 * run on comment-stripped source, so prose naming a route or the hook is not
 * a hit. Each discovery asserts a non-zero count: a sweep that finds nothing
 * would agree with every allowlist, so an empty match set fails instead.
 *
 * Its honest limit: it recognises a request by the route literal. A route
 * built from pieces (`"/api/insights/" + name`) or read from a constant in
 * another module would slip it; `AI_ROUTE_PATTERNS` lists the literal shapes
 * the tree uses today.
