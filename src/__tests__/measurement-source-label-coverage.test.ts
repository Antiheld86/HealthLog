/**
 * Every provenance enum member a surface renders must have a label.
 *
 * Settings → Sources listed `GOOGLE_HEALTH`, `OURA`, `POLAR` and `STRAVA` by
 * their internal name for a full release line: the label catalogue was
 * written when the enum was seven members long, the render path falls back
 * to the raw value, and nothing failed when a provider landed without its
 * label. Same fall-through in the measurement list (the source facet offers
 * every enum member) and on the medication intake caption, where the v1.28
 * Apple Health dose sync reads `via APPLE_HEALTH`.
 *
 * The member list comes from `prisma/schema.prisma` — the enum itself, not a
 * copy of it — so the next provider cannot ship without its label. Each
 * catalogue is checked in two steps: the map has an entry for the member,
 * and the key that entry names resolves to a real string in EVERY locale
 * bundle (a key that resolves nowhere renders as the key, which is no better
 * than the enum value it replaced).
 *
 * Mutation check: drop a member from either map and this goes red naming it;
 * point one at a key the bundles do not carry and the resolve arm goes red.
