/**
 * Structural guard: every runtime skip in the e2e suite says why.
 *
 * A runtime `test.skip(condition, reason)` or `test.fixme(condition, reason)`
 * turns a test off without failing anything, and a skipped test reads like a
 * passing one in a CI summary. `delegated-writes.spec.ts` skipped every test on
 * every run that way: its condition was evaluated before the form it checked
 * for had painted. The reason string is what makes a skip reviewable, so every
 * conditional call must carry one, and a bare `test.skip()` (which cannot) is
 * refused outright.
 *
 * This is the per-call half. The per-file half, a spec whose every test
 * skipped in CI, is `scripts/check-e2e-skipped-specs.mjs`, run by the e2e
 * workflow's gate job over the Playwright JSON reports.
 *
 * The matcher reads the call's arguments with a small bracket-aware scanner
 * rather than a regex, because conditions span lines and reasons are
 * concatenated. Its limit: a skip reached through another name (an alias of
 * `test`, `testInfo.skip`) is not seen. The non-empty assertion below keeps the
 * matcher from going quietly green by matching nothing.
