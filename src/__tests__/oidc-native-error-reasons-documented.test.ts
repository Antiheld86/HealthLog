/**
 * The native OIDC leg ends at `healthlog://oidc-callback?error=<reason>`, and
 * the app maps each reason to its own message. The only written contract for
 * that vocabulary is the login route's 302 description in the OpenAPI
 * registry (the callback itself is provider-driven and has no entry).
 *
 * An app build once matched against hyphenated shorthand from a coordination
 * note (`identity-conflict`) while the server sent `oidc_identity_conflict`,
 * so every reason fell through to the generic message. This binds the two
 * ends that can be read exactly: every reason either route can send on a
 * redirect a native client may receive is named in that description, and
 * nothing is named there that no route sends.
 *
 * Its limit: it reads string literals passed to the redirect helpers, so a
 * reason assembled at runtime would slip past it. None is today.
