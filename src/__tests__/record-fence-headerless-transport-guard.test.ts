/**
 * A fenced route may not be reached by a transport that cannot carry a header.
 *
 * The record-session fence is asserted on request HEADERS, attached inside
 * `src/lib/api/api-fetch.ts`. Three browser transports never go through that
 * wrapper and cannot be made to:
 *
 *   * `<img src="/api/…">` — the browser issues the subresource itself;
 *   * `<iframe src="/api/…">` — likewise, and it is a document load;
 *   * `<a href="/api/…" download>` — a navigation, not a fetch.
 *
 * On a session that has never entered a shared record this is invisible: the
 * fence exempts `record_epoch = 0`, so a headerless request is served exactly
 * as it always was. The moment the session enters or leaves a shared record the
 * epoch moves, the exemption ends, and every one of those three gets
 * `403 sharing.access.denied` — permanently, because nothing about them will
 * ever start sending a header. A thumbnail that silently stops rendering after
 * somebody visits a shared record is the shape of the bug.
 *
 * The fix shape already existed in the repository before this guard did:
 * `src/components/documents/document-ai-transport.ts` reaches
 * `/api/documents/inbound/{id}/original` through `apiFetchRaw` and turns the
 * blob into a `File`. Everything here follows it — fetch through the app
 * transport, hand the DOM an object URL, revoke it on unmount.
 *
 * ## What this matcher can and cannot see
 *
 * It resolves ONE level of local aliasing: `const src = \`/api/…\`` followed by
 * `src={src}` is caught, because that is the shape the real offenders had and a
 * matcher that only read inline literals would have found two of the six and
 * reported success. It does NOT trace a path built by a helper, assembled
 * across two hops, or returned from a hook — a future offender in that shape
 * slips this guard. Said here rather than discovered later.
 *
 * It also only knows the routes it can RESOLVE. A path whose route module it
 * cannot find is reported separately rather than silently passing, because an
 * unresolvable path is the one case where a green result would mean nothing.
