/**
 * Structural guard: a script a runbook tells the operator to run inside the
 * container is actually in the image, together with every local file it
 * imports.
 *
 * ## The failure this freezes
 *
 * `docs/ops/password-reset.md` told operators to run
 * `docker compose exec app node scripts/reset-password.mjs`, and the runner
 * stage of the Dockerfile copied nothing from `scripts/`: the standalone
 * output does not carry it. The recovery path for a locked-out admin failed
 * with "Cannot find module" at the moment it was needed. The intake-repair
 * runbook had the same gap under the `healthlog-tsx` launcher.
 *
 * ## What it proves and what it does not
 *
 * Every `docker compose exec … node scripts/…` or `healthlog-tsx scripts/…`
 * command in `docs/` names
 * a file the runner stage copies, and every relative import of that file is
 * copied too. Whether the package imports resolve is proved at image build by
 * the `RUN` checks next to the copies; this file cannot see the traced tree.
 * A command written in some other form (a different launcher) is outside the
 * matcher.
