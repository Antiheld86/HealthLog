/**
 * The moodLog bridge stays removed.
 *
 * It was retired once before, in pieces: the Settings card went in June, the
 * cron, webhook, credentials, ledger entry and roughly twenty i18n keys stayed
 * behind, and for a month the code ran hourly against an upstream that had
 * stopped answering while nothing on any screen said so. Half-removed was
 * worse than either finished state.
 *
 * This test pins the finished state. It is a structural guard, not a
 * behavioural one: it fails the moment a moodLog surface reappears, so a
 * reintroduction has to be a decision someone writes down rather than a merge
 * that slips through.
 *
 * What it deliberately does NOT forbid: the `MOODLOG` mood-entry source value
 * and its label. Rows the bridge imported are the user's own history, they
 * keep their provenance, and every read path must go on resolving it.
