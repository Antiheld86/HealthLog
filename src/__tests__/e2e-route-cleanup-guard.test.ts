/**
 * Structural guard on the E2E suite's route-cleanup boundary.
 *
 * A spec that arms `page.route(...)` in a `beforeEach` and never drops the
 * handler races its own teardown: the context closes, an in-flight handler
 * rejects, and Playwright reports a test that had already passed as failed.
 * `e2e/setup/test.ts` removes the possibility with an auto fixture, but only
 * for specs that take their `test` from there — a spec that imports straight
 * from `@playwright/test` silently opts out and looks identical in review.
 *
 * So the entry point is the invariant, and this file is what keeps it true.
 * It is a tripwire, not a proof: it shows nobody has changed the import
 * boundary without editing this file. That the fixture actually cleans up is
 * a runtime property, proven by the suite itself.
