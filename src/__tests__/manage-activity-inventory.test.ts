/**
 * Every MANAGE-admitted action names itself, in all six locales.
 *
 * ## What this asks that the sibling guard does not
 *
 * `src/lib/record-activity/__tests__/verb-map-covers-routes.test.ts` asks the
 * same question of the WRITE surface: a delegable write whose audit action has
 * no sentence renders as "made a change". MANAGE is where that answer stops
 * being merely vague and starts being wrong. A WRITE delegate can only add,
 * and "somebody added something" is at least the right shape of fact. A MANAGE
 * delegate can change and remove entries the owner made themselves, so the
 * generic line would tell an owner that something happened in their record
 * while withholding the only part they need — whether a reading was corrected
 * or deleted, whether a medication was stopped, whether the dose history was
 * purged. The level ships under "reconstructable or refused", and a feed that
 * cannot say which verb ran does not reconstruct anything.
 *
 * So the inventory here is the MANAGE half of the same sweep, and it goes two
 * steps further than its sibling:
 *
 *   1. it resolves the sentence by CALLING the map rather than by matching
 *      `case "…"` in its source, because a `case` inside a comment matches and
 *      an action whose arm falls through to the fallback does not;
 *   2. it follows the resolved key into all six bundles, because a key that
 *      exists only in English renders as its own dotted path to everyone else.
 *
 * ## PHI
 *
 * Two legs, and both are about the same failure. The activity feed reads out
 * of the audit table, the audit table is not encrypted, and the temptation
 * whenever a sentence feels thin is to put the value in it — "{name} changed
 * your weight from 81 to 78". That is a health figure in a second store with
 * its own retention and no rotation story. So: every verb line interpolates
 * `name` and nothing else, in every locale, and the feed's own DTO carries no
 * `details` field for a future caller to reach for.
 *
 * ## Why the counts are of MATCHES
 *
 * The verdict is an empty list of unmapped actions, and an empty match set
 * says exactly the same thing. Every leg therefore pins the size of what it
 * matched — modules walked, MANAGE modules found, one of them named, actions
 * read, sentences resolved — so a matcher that quietly stopped matching fails
 * instead of passing. `describe("the matcher sees what it looks for")` proves
 * both halves against synthetic modules, including the one shape that silenced
 * the sibling guard: a resolver call prettier broke across lines.
