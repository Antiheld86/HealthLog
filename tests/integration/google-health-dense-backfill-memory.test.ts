/**
 * #1023 — a full-history Google Health backfill over a dense heart-rate
 * stream, with its live memory measured rather than assumed.
 *
 * What this pins. The backfill read every heart-rate point of the account's
 * history into one array, mapped all of it into a second array, and wrote the
 * lot in one call, so the raw points, the readings and the write's working
 * sets were resident together and all of them scaled with the history. A
 * watch that records a reading a minute passes a million points in two years:
 * reproduced on 1.3 M readings under `--max-old-space-size=1024`, the backfill
 * reaches `FATAL ERROR: Reached heap limit` within seconds, and because the
 * backfill lane shares the app process, the whole instance restarts. The walk
 * now writes each page as it arrives, and the cycle's deferred-rollup ledger
 * keeps one key per touched day instead of one per reading.
 *
 * How it measures. Every heap reading is taken after a forced collection, so
 * what is compared is what the code HOLDS, not how much garbage V8 chose to
 * leave lying about. And what is compared is GROWTH: the heap once a quarter
 * of the pages have been read, against the most it reaches afterwards. The
 * first pages carry a fixed cost that has nothing to do with the stream
 * (modules loaded on first use, the ORM's compiled queries), and that cost is
 * about the size of this fixture, so an absolute figure could not tell a
 * streaming walk from one that holds everything. Growth can: a walk that
 * holds one page stays flat, a walk that holds what it has read climbs with
 * every page.
 *
 * The two halves are the point: the backfill stays inside the budget, and
 * collecting the same collection into one array (what the backfill used to do
 * before anything else) does not. Without the second half the budget could
 * be any number and the first would still pass.
 *
 * Google's API is replaced at the `safeFetch` seam by a generator that builds
 * each page on request, so the fixture itself never sits in memory.
