/**
 * REGRESSION — a rollup bucket must not narrate rows that no longer exist.
 *
 * The read-swap in `tiered-context.ts` falls back to live SQL only when a band
 * is EMPTY, so a bucket that is merely WRONG is served as though it were
 * current. The one staleness repair, `ensureUserRollupsFresh`, recomputes the
 * DAY tier over the trailing 90 days only, and keys off `Measurement.updatedAt`
 * — which a HARD delete does not bump. `src/lib/whoop/sync-body.ts` performs
 * exactly such a hard `measurement.deleteMany` on a WEIGHT row with no rollup
 * invalidation, so this reproduces that shape against a MONTH-band bucket.
 *
 * Before the fix the Coach snapshot carried two irreconcilable accounts of the
 * same record with nothing marking which to believe: `coarse.monthly` reported
 * the deleted value while `aggregate.allTimeMin/Max` beside it reported only
 * the surviving one, under an `asOf` stamped current because it is derived from
 * raw reading age and knows nothing about rollup age.
 *
 * `annotateSnapshotFreshness` now reconciles the two where they are assembled.
 * A bucket mean is an average of real rows, so it must lie within those rows'
 * all-time extremes; a mean outside them proves the bucket outlived its rows.
 * The disputed coarse tail is dropped and `asOf.coarseHistoryWithheld` records
 * that it was — narrating a ghost is worse than narrating less.
 *
 * `currentForTodayClaims` deliberately stays true here. It means "the freshest
 * READING is recent enough for present tense", and it is: the surviving rows
 * are from today. Suppressing it would silence a true statement to punish a
 * stale history band.
 *
 * The row on disk is still wrong. The deeper fix is to make the tier notice —
 * either compare a bucket's `computedAt` against the type's in-window
 * MAX(`updatedAt`), or invalidate on the hard-delete path — and that is a
 * larger change than this honesty repair.
