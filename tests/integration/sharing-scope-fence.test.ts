/**
 * v1.37.0 — the section fence, driven as routes against real Postgres.
 *
 * A scoped grant opens the sections it names and leaves the rest unanswered.
 * That sentence is one line of code in the resolver and fifty-seven
 * classifications on the call sites, and the classifications are the part a
 * machine cannot check: the guard freezes the domain a module declares against
 * a literal transcribed from the same table a human read, so a domain assigned
 * wrongly in both places agrees with itself perfectly. It would look like
 * nothing, anywhere, while a delegate scoped to medications quietly read the
 * labs.
 *
 * So this file drives one representative route per section, in-scope and
 * out-of-scope, through the shipped GET exports and the shipped grant
 * transitions. Sixteen legs plus the record-wide pair. What that buys is not
 * proof that every one of the fifty-seven is right — it is proof that the
 * mechanism separates the sections at all, per section, so a wholesale failure
 * (the resolver ignoring the scope, the normaliser reading a set as
 * permissive, one section's routes classified into another's) cannot be
 * silent. The per-module classification stays a review question and says so in
 * the guard.
 *
 * Evidence over verdict, throughout: the in-scope leg asserts the route was
 * REACHED, the out-of-scope leg asserts the refusal AND its audit reason. A
 * file that only asserted the refusals would pass against a resolver that
 * refused everything.
