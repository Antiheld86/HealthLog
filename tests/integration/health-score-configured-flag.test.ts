/**
 * v1.35.0 — the resolved "this score is configured" flag, over the real
 * wires.
 *
 * The flag is one boolean, and the whole point of resolving it on the
 * server is that no client ever interprets a configuration blob to know
 * it. So the thing worth testing is not the resolver — it has its own
 * unit suite — but the pipe: the selection a person saves through the
 * real write route, read back by the real score reader, carried by the
 * real dashboard-snapshot builder, the real daily-digest builder and the
 * real derived-metric dispatcher, out through the three routes an iOS
 * widget, a watch complication and the web hero actually call.
 *
 * Both ends green with a hand-built object between them shipped an inert
 * fix in this repo once. Nothing here is hand-built: every scenario
 * writes a row, calls the routes, and reads the field off the response
 * body.
 *
 * **The definition under test.** The score is configured when the
 * composition it resolves to differs from the composition the account's
 * defaults would resolve to today, both narrowed by the same modules.
 * Hence the four negatives below, each of which is a way of ending up at
 * the default composition without meaning to say "configured":
 *
 *   - an account that never opened the surface;
 *   - an account that opened it and kept every pillar (it HAS a
 *     selection — `hasSelection` is true — and is still not configured);
 *   - an account whose disabled modules alone narrow the set;
 *   - an account that took out a pillar its modules had already
 *     withdrawn, so the composition is unchanged.
