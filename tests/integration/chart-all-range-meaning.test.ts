/**
 * v1.39.4 — the chart's "All" range means one thing at every history length.
 *
 * A long history is served from the WEEK or MONTH rollup tier, a short one
 * from DAY rows, and a coverage miss from the live table. The chart folds
 * whatever arrives into the average day of each week (a range up to two
 * years) or month (longer). Seeded with real rows and folded through the real
 * rollup writer, a fully covered week or month must read the same average day
 * on every path: for steps the average daily total, for a level the average
 * of its days. Before, a MONTH-tier month of steps read
 * as the month's total, about thirty times the same month served by days.
