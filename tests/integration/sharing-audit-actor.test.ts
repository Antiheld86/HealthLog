/**
 * What the audit trail records for a delegated action, and for a self action.
 *
 * The whole feature rests on one reading: `actorUserId` NULL means the account
 * acted for itself. Every row written before the column existed means that,
 * and every row written after it will mostly mean it too — so a threading rule
 * that stamps an actor where none was acting does not add information, it
 * changes what several years of history says. That reading is what these tests
 * hold, against real rows.
 *
 * Round trips through the real routes, for the reason that cost this project a
 * release: a unit stub proves the code ran, not what landed. Here the question
 * is only ever "which row exists afterwards, and what is in its columns".
