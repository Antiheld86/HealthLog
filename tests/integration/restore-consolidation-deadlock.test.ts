/**
 * #1031 — a restore and a consolidation pass over the same account must not
 * deadlock.
 *
 * Seen on a freshly booted instance: the restore's clearing step failed with
 * `40P01` while the boot-time step consolidation was folding the same
 * account. Each takes row locks on the account's readings in its own order.
 * A consolidation day first updates (or mints) the day's `stats:` total, then
 * soft-deletes the day's per-sample rows; the restore deletes every reading
 * of the account in one statement, in the order the table gives them. When
 * the restore reaches the day's samples before the total, each side holds
 * what the other one needs next.
 *
 * This file builds exactly that order, deterministically. The day's samples
 * are written before its (soft-deleted) total, so the restore's delete meets
 * them first, and a row trigger holds the consolidation for three seconds
 * right after it has locked the total. The restore is started while it waits.
 *
 * What must hold: both finish, neither is chosen as a deadlock victim, and
 * the account ends up as the backup says. Every writer of the consolidation
 * family now takes the restore's account lock in shared mode at the start of
 * its day transaction, and the restore takes it exclusively before its first
 * delete, so the two are ordered by that lock before either touches a row. A
 * consolidation that finds a restore running leaves the account for its next
 * run instead of waiting on it.
 *
 * Mutation check: remove the `holdAccountAgainstRestore` call from the step
 * consolidation's day transaction and the first test fails with the
 * consolidation rejected on `40P01`.
