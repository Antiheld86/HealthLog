/**
 * The eleven delegated writes, driven as routes, against real Postgres.
 *
 * Same construction as `sharing-delegable-routes.test.ts` and for the same
 * reason: every case imports the shipped `POST` export and calls it, so the
 * real `apiHandler`, the real `requireRecordAuth`, the real grant table and
 * the real Prisma writes are what answer. A test that rebuilt a handler would
 * be testing its own copy of a substitution that happens above the handler
 * body, and would keep passing after the route stopped performing it.
 *
 * The grant is minted through `inviteGrant` + `acceptGrant` rather than
 * hand-planted, because "a WRITE grant exists" and "a WRITE grant can be
 * created by the invitation flow this release ships" are different claims and
 * the second is the one a caregiver depends on.
 *
 * Five questions per verb:
 *
 *   1. a delegate with a live WRITE grant writes into the OWNER's record —
 *      the row lands under the owner and NOT under the delegate;
 *   2. the same delegate under a READ grant is refused
 *      `sharing.access.denied`, and no row is written;
 *   3. a caller who was never granted anything is refused the same way;
 *   4. after revocation the very NEXT request is refused — no re-login, no
 *      cache window;
 *   5. a caller who has not switched gets exactly what they got before.
 *
 * (5) is the regression that matters most. Eleven verbs changed; a person who
 * shares nothing must not be able to tell.
 *
 * Beyond the five, three properties that are specific rather than structural:
 * the audit row carries `userId = owner` AND `actorUserId = delegate` (the
 * pipe, not just the ends — `actingActorFor` reads the wide-event context, so
 * a stamped row proves the context was set); the side-effect rate bucket keys
 * on the ACTOR; and both intake routes hand the OWNER and the ACTOR to the
 * notification helper rather than one id twice.

 * owner's medication reminders off for years and every surface built to make
 * delegation visible would have called it marking a dose.
 *
 * Flipping an already-resolved event is the second: taken to skipped rewrites
 * the owner's compliance history and refunds inventory, and the consent screen
 * promises that changing what is already there stays with the owner.
 *
