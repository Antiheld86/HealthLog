/**
 * Issue #1026 — a daily total must land on the same calendar day whichever
 * chart range reads it.
 *
 * The 7-day chart pulls raw rows and buckets them by the user's own calendar
 * day. The 30-day chart reads the daily series from the rollup tier, whose
 * DAY buckets are cut at UTC midnight, and the chart then labels each bucket's
 * UTC-midnight start in the user's zone. East of UTC a sample shortly after
 * local midnight was counted on the previous day; west of UTC every bucket
 * was labelled one day early. Steps, active energy, flights and distance are
 * summed per day, so the drift showed up as whole totals moving between
 * neighbouring days when the range changed.
 *
 * This file seeds cumulative samples right next to local midnight for a
 * positive, a half-hour and a negative offset, warms the rollup tier the way
 * the live instance has it, and asserts that the daily series (both the
 * rollup-backed read and the live aggregate) buckets by the user's day.
