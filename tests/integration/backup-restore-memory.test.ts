/**
 * #1031 — what a restore holds while it writes the measurements, measured.
 *
 * A self-hoster restored 1.8 million readings in the default 1 GB container
 * (V8 heap limit 524 MB). Near the end of the measurement write the server
 * restarted, and the job started over from the beginning. Reproduced against
 * the same restore of 1.8 million Apple Health readings, the restore itself
 * held a steady 60 MB more than the process did before it started, from the
 * hundredth statement to the last: not the rows it was writing, but the
 * parameters of the hundred statements before them.
 *
 * Prisma's debug logger keeps the arguments of its last hundred calls whether
 * or not logging is on, and the client and the Postgres adapter log each
 * statement with its parameters. A restore that wrote 1 000 readings per
 * statement therefore kept about the last 100 000 readings alive as copies.
 * Bounded, and the same at 150 000 readings as at 1.8 million, but 60 MB out
 * of a heap that a long-running server already fills well past half. The
 * insert now carries at most a hundred rows per statement, and the history
 * holds about a tenth of that.
 *
 * How it measures. Every reading is taken after a forced collection, so what
 * is compared is what the restore HOLDS, not what V8 left lying about. The
 * anchor is taken when the measurement write starts, after the checks and the
 * clearing, so the modules and compiled queries they load are not counted.
 * The fixture is sized so the old statement size fills the whole history
 * well before the end: 150 statements of 1 000 readings.
 *
 * Mutation check: set `MEASUREMENT_INSERT_ROWS_PER_STATEMENT` to 1 000 and
 * the growth test goes red at about 64 MB against the 20 MB budget.
