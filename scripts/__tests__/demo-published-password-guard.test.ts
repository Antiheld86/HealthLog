/**
 * The demo password is published in the README so anyone can sign in to
 * demo.healthlog.dev. Its Argon2id hash lives in two places that must agree:
 *
 *   - scripts/seed-demo.ts          writes it when a demo tenant is seeded
 *   - scripts/migrate-demo-edge01.sh overwrites it after a migration load
 *
 * Public issue #805: the migration used to carry the SOURCE account's hash
 * across instead, so once the operator rotated their own demo password the
 * credentials the README advertises stopped working, and nothing noticed until
 * a visitor filed a bug. These assertions make the two copies move together.
