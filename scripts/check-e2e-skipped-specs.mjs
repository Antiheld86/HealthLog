/**
 * Fail CI when a whole e2e spec file ran nothing.
 *
 * A spec that skips all of its tests reports green, and in a summary a quiet
 * skip looks exactly like a pass. `delegated-writes.spec.ts` skipped every
 * test on every run for months that way: its skip condition was evaluated
 * before the form it looked for had painted.
 *
 * This reads Playwright's JSON report (one per shard; the e2e workflow's gate
 * job passes all of them) and counts, per spec FILE, the tests that ran across
 * every project and shard together. A file is only reported when none of its
 * tests ran anywhere, so a mobile-only spec that skips on the desktop project
 * is fine as long as the mobile project ran it. Aggregating across shards is
 * the reason this runs in the gate job and not inside each shard: a shard can
 * receive only the skipped half of a file.
 *
 * A file that is meant to skip entirely goes in `ALLOWED_ALL_SKIPPED` below
 * with the reason written next to it. The per-call half of the rule, that
 * every conditional skip carries a reason, is the unit guard
 * `src/__tests__/e2e-conditional-skip-guard.test.ts`.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/check-e2e-skipped-specs.mjs <report.json> [...]
