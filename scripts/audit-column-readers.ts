/**
 * Release-battery sweep: which Prisma columns have no consumer, and which have
 * no writer at all?
 *
 * Run it as part of the deep-audit step, not in CI:
 *
 *     pnpm dlx tsx scripts/audit-column-readers.ts
 *     pnpm dlx tsx scripts/audit-column-readers.ts --model Measurement
 *     pnpm dlx tsx scripts/audit-column-readers.ts --all
 *
 * ## Why this is a script and not a test
 *
 * The question "does this column have a consumer anywhere in the tree" is a
 * whole-program property, and the only cheap way to approximate it is to read
 * the source without type information. That approximation is unsound in both
 * directions. Generic field names (`value`, `type`, `state`, `source`) match
 * unrelated identifiers and read as consumed when they are not. Consumption
 * through a select-less `findUnique` plus whole-row serialization reads as
 * unconsumed when it is not. Dynamic selects fall outside the matcher.
 *
 * A gate built on that matcher would drift towards green and stop meaning
 * anything, which is exactly the failure this whole family of guards exists to
 * prevent — a pair guard that quietly degrades into a one-end guard is worse
 * than no guard, because it also removes the suspicion. So this stays a review
 * tool with a human reading the output. The two questions that CAN be answered
 * exactly — is every account-payload field consumed, is every Measurement
 * column backed up — are tests instead:
 * `src/__tests__/account-payload-consumer-guard.test.ts` and
 * `src/__tests__/measurement-backup-completeness.test.ts`.
 *
 * ## What the matcher does, and where it stops
 *
 * Each file is masked once (comments, string bodies and regex literals blanked
 * in place, `${…}` substitutions kept as code because `` `${row.field}` `` is a
 * real read). Every `<key>: {` / `<key>: [` block is then bracket-matched and
 * the characters inside it are tagged with the role that key gives them:
 *
 *   - write   — `data` `create` `createMany` `update` `updateMany` `upsert`
 *               `set` `connectOrCreate`
 *   - project — `select` `include` (a projection IS a read of the column)
 *   - query   — `where` `orderBy` `cursor` `distinct` `having` `by` `omit`
 *
 * Nesting resolves innermost-wins, so the `where` inside an `upsert` is a
 * query and the `data` beside it is a write. That distinction is the whole
 * point of the rewrite: the previous matcher counted every `<field>:` key
 * anywhere as a write, so a column that is only ever FILTERED ON looked
 * written-but-unread. All twelve findings it reported were that one mistake.
 *
 * Known limits, stated plainly so nobody mistakes a clean run for a proof:
 *
 *   - Counts are per identifier, not per model. Two models with a `lastSeenAt`
 *     share one tally, so a read of either satisfies both. This is the same
 *     imprecision `GENERIC_NAMES` exists for, and it applies to every name.
 *   - `obj.field = …` counts as a write even when `obj` never reaches the
 *     database. Without it the settings layer, which assembles its update
 *     objects field by field, reads as columns nothing writes.
 *   - A non-Prisma object literal under a `data:` key (a chart series, a
 *     react-query result) is counted as a write.
 *   - A payload returned by a helper rather than declared beside its Prisma
 *     call is still invisible; the dataflow pass is one hop and one file.
 *   - Raw SQL is classified by keyword only: a literal shaped like INSERT or
 *     UPDATE…SET donates writes, one shaped like SELECT…FROM donates reads,
 *     for both the field name and its `@map` column name.
 *   - Relation attributes are read one line at a time; a `@relation(…)` split
 *     across lines would not register its `fields: […]`.
 *
 * ## The annotation convention
 *
 * A pull request that adds a column, payload field, or preference contains its
 * consumer. When it genuinely cannot, the schema comment says so and this
 * sweep treats the marker as an expiring allowlist entry:
 *
 *     /// @pending-consumer(#123) — iOS reads this from v1.33; server-side unread until then.
 *     /// @internal: cooldown bookkeeping for the reminder cron; never surfaced.
 *
 * `@internal` is permanent and silences the field. `@pending-consumer` is
 * temporary: the field stays out of the findings list but is reported
 * separately every run, so an issue that closed without the consumer landing
 * becomes visible at the next release audit instead of never.
